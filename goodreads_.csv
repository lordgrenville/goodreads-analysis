What more boring topic is imaginable? But since the book came out, containers are <i>in</i>; in  art, architecture, history, and even computer programming. Levinson argues that the container's importance as catalyst of globalisation may have shaped the modern economic landscape more than any other factor, although it's hard to corroborate - the book is intentionally written without quantitative support, perhaps owing to the paucity of data.<br/><br/>The core story is in many ways a neoliberal parable, with technological innovation and the irrepressible entrepreneur Malcolm McLean overcoming corrupt and inefficient dockers' unions, who wish to oppose progress even as their jobs become less and less relevant. But Levinson, a former <i>Economist</i> reporter with a fairly eclectic background, is too good a historian to paint things only one way. In a detailed - too detailed? - history of negotiations between the longshoremen's union and port authorities in San Francisco, a deal was struck whereby a tax on the new shipping containers would pay to make up for lost jobs, paying people for eight-hour days until retirement and preserving their pensions, while reducing the amount of new hires. Automation thus actually brought about better conditions (less physical strain, and fixed instead of provisional work), though ultimately there would be fewer jobs. And It was less fun - the romance of the docks was gone for good, with famous port towns replaced by large, factory-like ports in little-known cities. (A rare bird this: a labour history written by a neoliberal!)<br/><br/>Not just shipping jobs, either: the great decline in American manufacturing, and some of the politics of our moment, can be traced to the evisceration of shipping costs, which drastically shrunk the planet. In the global, hyperefficient market, there is room only for a few large players, and most port cities - and shipping lines and manufacturing industries - will lose. Today's behemoths are globe-striding conglomerates such as Maersk (formally Danish) and Mediterranean Shipping Company (Swiss). Previously shipping company were national and often regulated and subsidised; the US still has on its books the Jones Act, which requires ships trading between US ports to be American built and crewed, and it's unlikely to be repealed anytime soon. <br/><br/>There are definitely some tedious parts in this book (an entire chapter on ideal box size and design!) But I'm glad I read it: it tells the history of an unsexy, little-recognised, low-margin industry, that is intimately connected to every product we buy.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.8599999999999999,2020,1,427.0

(A friend says no one has ever finished [b:Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid|24113|Gödel, Escher, Bach  An Eternal Golden Braid|Douglas R. Hofstadter|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547125681l/24113._SY75_.jpg|850076]. I  vaguely seem to remember finishing it, but don't remember much after the early sections about recursion.)<br/><br/>I'd say I knew a lot of the material covered here, but still enjoyed seeing Mitchell pull it together, connecting the historical progress of AI from its inception (John McCarthy and Symbolic AI) to today's landscape of souped-up neural networks vacuuming up VC cash, and filled in some gaps (her explanation of DeepMind's ""Q-Learning"" system, which allowed them to feed Atari games into a CNN, was very helpful). I should stress that no mathematical or programming knowledge is required for this book, and Mitchell's explanatory skills are superb.<br/><br/>In some ways the <i>bête noire</i> of this book is futurist Ray Kurzweil. Mitchell is somewhat sceptical about ""Artificial General Intelligence"", but modestly acknowledges that as she has been wrong in past predictions she might be wrong again. (Strong opinions, lightly held, as they say). The paradox at the heart of this book was expressed by AI pioneer John McCarthy as ""as soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore"". On the one hand, goal after goal has been set up as achievable only by human-level intelligence, only to be beaten by AI (the highest-profile recent one being the defeat of Go champion Lee Sedol by a Google program, and his subsequent retirement). On the other, we still feel that <i>this isn't the real thing</i> - AI fails miserably at a lot of tasks simple for humans. Another quote from a major AI figure, Marvin Minsky: ""easy things are hard”. Mitchell takes the side of programmer Mitch Kapor in his <a href=”http://longbets.org/1/”>Long Bet</a> against Kurzweil, again expressing openness to the idea that she may be wrong.  I’m on Mitchell’s side too, and this book is a tonic against the relentless hype (Mitchell punctures some of IBM’s desperate, highly misleading marketing of their various Watson products, trying to convey immense capability on the back of their ballyhooed <i>Jeopardy</i> win.)<br/><br/>On AI ethics, Mitchell covers some of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction"">Cathy O'Neil's ground</a> much more sensibly, noting potential issues but seeing them more as implementation parameters than as fundamental to the technology (though a cynic might note that Mitchell is a researcher, O’Neil a former practitioner). I’d add (my own thoughts, not hers) that critiques of facial recognition are contradictory: either that it isn’t good enough, or that it's too good. If the first (eg some systems are bad at recognising black people), that's just a trivial engineering problem (train models on more non-white people!) If that it's liable to flag people inaccurately: we already have a model called ""personal names"" that can flag people inaccurately (this happened to a friend who was stopped crossing a South American border because she shared a name with a criminal). This is not a big deal, just like ""deepfakes"" aren't a bigger deal then Photoshop  - people will just adjust their priors and learn to be more sceptical. But if the issue is that if the tech <i>does</i> work, it's a fundamental violation of civil rights - that's an intriguing claim deserving of consideration. But then we should treat it like any constitutional question: the police should freely proceed, and when it inevitably ends up in the courts, judges - experts of matters of rights and law - will make the call, as they should.<br/><br/>One quibble about the audiobook version: the narrator (Abby Craden) makes some risible errors in pronouncing symbols, such as top-5 as ""top minus 5”, and #CANNIBALS (where the hash stands for ""number of"") as ""hashtag cannibals"". (Mitchell reads the intro herself, which is great.) That aside: this is a brilliant, up-to-date book, which I’ll henceforth refer people to when they ask what I do!",,,1,,,0,,,,,,female,0.6299999999999999,2020,1,674.0

From my first encounter as a teenager, it has always been utterly and irrevocably clear to me that the bureaucratic forms in Kafka are <i>metaphors</i> for existence - Kafka's angst stems not from much-needed civil service reform, but from the bewildering and alienating state of being into which we are (in Heidegger's term) thrown at birth, in which no explanations are given, from which there is no escape.<br/><br/>But sometimes I do have to admit: it <i>does</i> also work as a satire of bureaucracy.<br/><br/>Brian O'Nolan provides an interesting counterpoint to FK. No stranger in a strange land, he was a talented native son from a proudly nationalist family, and held a (prominent, prestigious) position as a government penpusher and rubber-stamper in a newly independent Ireland desperately poor and deeply conservative. Under various pseudonyms, he wrote newspaper columns and strange metafictional novels (as well as various detective potboilers), until his unmasking forced him into retirement. Unlike Kafka, he sees the system somewhat benignly from the inside of the beast, but he is fully aware of its absurdities, of the nihilistic stupidity of pompous policemen checking bicycle lamps in a starving country.<br/><br/>This book is less outwardly pomo than [b:At Swim-Two-Birds|97333|At Swim-Two-Birds|Flann O'Brien|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330416040l/97333._SY75_.jpg|983387] (in which the characters disobey the narrator), but it is still really weird. Bookended by a odd but straightforward plot involving double-crossing thieves, its core is a trippy, spiraling dreamworld of bicycles, alternative physics, a protagonist who forgets his name, and too many absurd and drily funny Beckettian miscellany to count. Like Borghes, O'Nolan likes pseudoscholarship, carefully footnoting and translating secondary literature on his made up philosopher de Selby, who believes the world sausage-shaped and mixes up men and women. It's notoriously impossible to define postmodernism, but include this trope: appropriating the <i>style of academic writing</i> as <i>medium for imaginative novel</i>, because you like the aesthetic texture (form) of the monograph but aren't particularly interested in its content. The ending does restore some connection to traditional literary terrain (it's a good one), but nonetheless, this isn't one for the faint-hearted.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.0099999999999998,2020,1,356.0

Such systems have certain benefits over human judgment - they are cheaper, and can avoid corruption and horse-trading - but they can be gamed, and sometimes make egregious mistakes (to take an example from early on in the book, mischaracterising a star teacher as failing because the teachers before her had inflated their students' reading scores by cheating, making it look as if the students had regressed under her tutelage). Furthermore, the subjects of such systems have less recourse than they usually would, as they don't understand the system's workings (which are often intentionally kept secret as proprietary IP); and the subjects tend to be disproportionately poor and from racial minorities (since the wealthier can afford more boutique, hand-operated systems).<br/> <br/>These, then, are the charges. I wasn't totally convinced. Sometimes O'Neil seems to dislike all metrics that make people feel bad, or that say bad things (even if true!) about vulnerable groups: near the end she attacks the metric of Body Mass Index (BMI, used by health insurance companies), claiming that it was invented 200 years ago by a Belgian who knew nothing about health, and that NBA players would have an unhealthy BMI since muscle weighs more than fat. Is this really true? BMI is a widely used metric, and surely insurance companies would want something better if it really didn't predict health outcomes, but O'Neil doesn't elaborate. Also, near the end of the book she implies that the titular ""WMDs"" she deplores would be acceptable if used for good. So...actually she likes metrics? As long as they're used to help people? This book contains no mathematical arguments - it's an essayistic critique of WMDs, so this walking back seems to undermine the whole argument.  Saying that WMDs are good if used for good is a tautology; just as well write a book saying guns are bad when used to shoot impoverished people of colour, but good when used to defend them. Who would argue?<br/><br/>O'Neil has impeccable credentials - a former Ivy League maths professor, she then tripled her salary as a quant at the elite D.E. Shaw* hedge fund, and then rebranded herself as a Data Scientist, holding several positions in the for- and non-profit sector. She also has firm political convictions: having seen the 2008 financial crisis from Wall Street, she became convinced that insufficient risk assessment by the bankers had led to the economic turmoil, and later joined the Occupy movement (despite not completely agreeing with their economic analysis).<br/><br/>And she does score some good points. More transparency should be required from purveyors of algorithmic solutions, as well as some form of appeal. Perhaps I'm resistant only because her central critique has become a truism: big data and ""algorithms"" don't contain some kind of hidden wisdom, they just scale up the same incomplete and biased heuristics that have always been used. And sometimes they're used to sneak in something which is effective but politically unpalatable. Companies caught doing this deserve to be shamed.<br/><br/>*Funnily enough, Shaw was denied tenure in the CS department of O'Neil's old employer Columbia. He went on to monetise his ideas and make bank.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,female,1.8599999999999999,2020,1,549.0

The overall arc of the book is how capitalism grew up, or how in the words of Matt Levine (maybe the best of today's chroniclers of capitalism) “<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-18/aramco-s-ipo-is-just-for-practice"">everything is too efficient and it’s exhausting</a>”. The market went from a cozy business of deals between friends who went to the same select schools, to a sharp-edged, constant race to carve out slight profits, where any rest would let the competition ahead of you. Which is fairer, and better for everyone; but obviously worse for the incumbents, less interesting to read about, and also just sort of exhausting.<br/><br/>As the subtitle promises, it is a history of modern financial capitalism, at least in the Morgansphere - which is a lot, but still Atlanto-centric (East Coast, England, France). Many of today's concerns were just as big then: the fiery populist Williams Jennings Bryant railed against Wall Street, the trust-buster Taft thundered, and then the pro-business McKinley was elected. After the 1907 crash Wall Street got a bailout but the Federal Reserve was founded, taking control of future crises. There's a sovereign loan to China which goes bad: American bankers lent money to the doomed Manchu dynasty and had the loans assured by US soldiers, capitalism and political power fusing (a common theme in the book, especially in the next section). But after a popular uprising the Manchus were chased out and Sun Yat-Sen's republic was founded.<br/><br/>During the next section, the ""diplomatic age"" (end of WWI-end of WWII) the government used bankers to carry out its policy at a remove, while bankers used the government to enforce loan collection. Populist US president Warren Harding wanted European war debt collected, while the arch-Anglophile Morgans wanted to cancel it on moral grounds. But the public was on Harding's side. Since the US was tough on the Allied powers, they in turn had to be tough on Germany in order to afford their payments, leading to well-known unpleasant consequences. Some of America's industrialists were more provincial, but the bankers, as today, were international-minded, interested in European stability and English success as much as their own profits.<br/><br/>Part of the full Morgan service was political clout and behind the scenes influence, which could have bad consequences in the diplomatic age when governments were clients of big banking houses. The liberal Tom Lamont represented Japan and fascist Italy, and tried with his diplomatic/media connections to drum up support for the invasion of Manchuria.<br/><br/>In this era the typical Morgan man was an Episcopalian, Ivy-educated white male, a pro-business Republican and liberal internationalist. He would live in an Upper East Side condo, or at least Englewood. (Also acceptable was a Long Island estate from which he could yacht to work each morning.) He might be a member of a secretive club: the Zodiac club, for example, where every member is a powerful banker representing a zodiac sign. (This is 100% in the book.) <br/><br/>The old banking culture had certain rules. Merchant bankers would only deal with big fish, and not make loans to retail/small businesses - you were proud of being a client of a big bank as it was mark of status. They didn't trade stocks, seeing it as speculation. There was a gentlemen's agreement not to poach clients - a bank wouldn't take a client without the consent of the rival bank. Which sounds like a cartel but wasn't because...basically they just agreed to be fair about it? It sort of worked with a small monoculture: everyone agreed that maximising the respect of the profession and maintaining banker's honour was better than trying to squeeze out higher fees. Finally, if you were a client the bank was invested in your success, so would take board seats (until eventually pressured not to) and advise, making sure the client succeeded so it reflected well on them.<br/><br/>As the Depression set in, anger turned on the bankers. The Glass-Steagall act was aimed at the House of Morgan, which did private banking for individuals (but only the ones they wanted, the very wealthy ones), but also was a merchant bank. The result was meiosis into JP Morgan (commercial) and Morgan Stanley (investment). In a sense this was unfair: the crisis wasn't caused by them, since they weren't speculators. But Morgan also made a fortune from the crisis, and the nation was desperately struggling, so their indignation rings hollow. (The tendency of very wealthy people to feel persecuted is a running motif in this section.)<br/><br/>Last year I reviewed [b:Louis D. Brandeis: American Prophet|27248488|Louis D. Brandeis  American Prophet|Jeffrey Rosen|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445549750l/27248488._SX50_.jpg|47297383]. This is kind of the origin story of his nemesis. Brandeis had the Jeffersonian idea that any business was bad if it grew beyond a certain point. But everyone has their perspective: Morgan ran a large network that preserved values of trust and banking ethics, and could bridge opposing parties (in the national as well as commercial world - this was the diplomatic age). At one point they argue that large trusts setting prices centrally would lead to better market outcomes than the wild fluctuations of capitalism, an almost socialist idea. (""Because the House of Morgan preached socialism for the rich, it always had a partial affinity for those who preached it for the poor."") But the world was getting too big for such a small group to handle, and the ""casino age"" dawned.<br/><br/>Previously banks had been guardians of capital - capital was scarce, and so they were also austere and unfriendly. Now it was abundant and banks had to chase business. There were many more  options for companies to raise money (issuing commercial paper, money markets) and banks needed to schmooze and actively chase down deals. (Today, too, you have Warren Buffett and Apple sitting on mountains of cash, desperate to find ways to invest it!)<br/><br/>In the casino age, relationships and traditions count for little, and any scrappy newcomer can win a client by offering lower fees or some new financial instrument. Less romance and secrecy, more efficiency and greed. This was more egalitarian, and bad for old-school bankers accustomed to easy livings, although the Morgans have done fine in the new order. The book covers the fate of minor offshoots like Morgan, Grenfell in London (the story of Rupert Murdoch's <i>News of the World</i> takeover is a good one). But the book sags a bit toward the end: this is just about banks eking out profits in creative ways, not anything world-historical.<br/><br/>This is a biography of the House of Morgan, and there is a fair amount of biographical information I haven't touched on, because although Chernow does a fair job of distilling the highlights, it isn't all that interesting (BUT did you know that J. Pierpont Morgan's youngest daughter Anne was a radical activist in the 1910s who lived in a lesbian <i>ménage à trois</i>!?) This book is worth reading inasmuch as it describes the mystique and magic of banking and its place in global history and politics; a story about a successful but elitist and self-enriching industry increasingly resented by an unequal society, a role better represented today by the tech industry. <i>Plus ça change</i>!",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.07000000000000028,2020,1,1287.0

Markovits doesn't just write female characters clumsily - the kind of stuff lampooned on <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/"">r/menwritingwomen</a>. Well, he does that too:  ""she stepped prettily along the pavement"" occurs twice on one page. But there's something more in this tale of fathers and daughters (an early working title) where every woman's looks and sexual attractiveness are dissected in depth, and the ambience of ""daddy issues"" manifests in every father's lecherous imagination and every daughter's insecure, libidinous daydreams. There is also a running theme of upper-crust antisemitism played at a slightly higher intensity than seems warranted. Everyone speaks in long, complex sentences, except for the Jewish characters who use the LES Yinglish of yesteryear (""So? You think like this I should suffer?""), even when they're American-born. I imagine Markovits is at least partly Jewish and am not accusing him of prejudice, just a bizarre creative choice.

It is structured as a series of four loosely connected stories related to an expensive Manhattan prep school, each representing a season in a school year. The characters are brutally, constitutionally unhappy people, pushing away those who love them and unable to connect. At times it is hard to read, but they are always thoughtful and so, so eloquent. Does anyone, even Ivy-educated prep school teachers, talk in such literary and complex sentences, casually extemporising lines from John Ashberry? I don't know but I love it. And Markovits, a native Texan, lovingly renders snowy Midtown streets and spring in the park among well-heeled and well-educated socialites, the lazy comfortable happiness of Whit Stillman films, and I can never pass on that; so, all the stars I guess.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.71,2020,1,339.0

Most pop-science books either do too much to cater to the lowest common denominator (""black holes are like BIG balls of ENERGY that go CRASH""), or else the opposite - they're written by domain experts like Stephen Hawking who try to explain their ideas without any maths (""black holes are, for reasons too complicated to explain here, shaped like eight-dimensional tori""). Unfortunately this book is firmly in the first category. <br/><br/>Metzl has worked as a White House policy analyst and a science-fiction writer, both jobs in which one must speculate wildly about the future with little penalty for inaccuracy. In general I tend to think that long-ranging predictions about nondeterministic systems are <i>always</i> a mug's game, and those foolhardy enough to try it develop a certain immunity to shame. This book contains a lot of speculation about the possibilities of genetic medicine and anti-aging research, and there is little reason to consider it likely.<br/><br/>Metzl - an irrepressible optimist - sums up the history and present state of genetics and extrapolates it forward, imagining a very credible slide towards a world of 1) freezing reproductive cells in one's physical prime, 2) widespread IVF and 3) embryo selection based on increasingly fine-grained genetic insights, including eventually not just weeding out diseases (single-gene ""Mendelian"" ones or otherwise) but also selection of physical or personality traits. Is our vague unease about ""designer babies"" likely to halt this progression? Consumed as we are by a million other less important debates, it's hard to see this changing - barring some horrifying scientific developments, of course. Metzl correctly lambasts Europeans for their irrational opposition to GMO crops, and ends with some milquetoast policy suggestions. (These include a ""Non-Proliferation Treaty"" for genetic enhancements - with more advanced nations sharing technology in exchange for agreement to stay within broadly agreed red lines - and distributing educational materials to foster more public dialogue.)<br/><br/>Anyway. It's striking to consider the high tide of bioethics, maybe from the Asilomar conference in 1975 until 9/11 erased stem cell research from the public consciousness. All that public nervousness about the future, seemingly much less audible today, seemed to bring about little gain: recombinant DNA research continued and created no monsters, IVF became a common if pricey recourse for couples struggling with infertility, and genetic screening before and after conception is now commonplace. CRISPR/Cas9 has thus far not sparked much ethical hand-wringing. Bioethicists and religious leaders have been left behind by the pace of science, and...so far, everything has been working out? <br/><br/>In sum: even though this book is scientifically shallow and not especially well written, it does round up the story so far and show a credible path forward.

Medieval philosophers spoke of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology"">negative theology</a>, in which one can only speak of what God is <i>not</i>, and in a way Leibowitz takes a similar route. Judaism to him is <i>not</i> almost everything it's perceived as, except for the practice of <i>mitzvot</i> for no end, joy or hope except the desire to serve an inscrutable God, an activity few can ever even fulfil.<br/><br/>Besides for this ideosyncratic religious philosophy, combining Maimonidean antimysticism with Kierkegaardian existentialism, Leibowitz is best known for his dovish political views related to the territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war. Highly unpopular at the time, this stance seems ever more justified as time passes, and is itself derived partly from his religious conception which stressed the individual nature of faith over national-religious fusion and what he called the ""idolatry"" of land and soil. <br/><br/>This collection gathers fragments of essays and interviews from several decades, so one sees Leibowitz's views change over time - a cohesive, systematic outline would have been nice, but it's possible that Leibowitz's views, positioned as they were in fiery response to accepted truths, resist systematisation. His opinions tend towards absolutism, resisting any shades of grey. (An essay on how the religious must step up and define how a religious state should work is immediately followed by ""a call for separation of religion and state""!) When asked if he wants a religious state (<i>medinat halakha</i>), he dodges. Figuring things out slowly over a period of historically unprecedented change is understandable, but at every stage he spoke with 100% conviction. He was a gadfly, fufilling a vital critical position, not suggesting solutions.<br/><br/>It's common today to hear religion defended on the grounds that it keeps people moral, or that it provides a community structure preventing loneliness, or that prayer and meditation improve mental health. For Leibowitz, none of these are <i>religious</i> reasons: religion in this case is instrumental, a means to provide other, human values. Religion to him can only make sense if practiced for its own sake, with no gain for the believer and even possible detriment - as exemplified by the cases of Abraham's sacrifice of his son or the book of Job (<a href=""https://www.biblestudytools.com/job/38.html"">God's response to Job</a> conveys the insignificance of man in the vast intricacy of the cosmos; at this scale, it is foolish to care much about any terrestrial problems). Even the prospect of divine reward in this world or the afterlife is to Leibowitz a crutch for doubters. True faith stands on its own as a loving, worshipful relationship between believer and God, structured by the complex, counterintuitive and often seemingly meaningless system of the <i>halacha</i>. This faith is not <i>for</i> any reason, or proven by anything; it is a first principle.  <br/><br/>An illustration Leibowitz repeatedly goes back to is the first two sections of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael""><i>Shema</i></a>. The first commands one to love God, with no reason given or reward promised. This is <i>lishma</i> - for its own sake. The second promises rain and plentiful harvests if one serves God, or otherwise the reverse; a completely different religious orientation. This is <i>shelo lishma</i>, for ulterior motives - also valid but a lower level of service.<br/><br/>Ethics, Leibowitz writes, is inherently atheistic, and the great ethicists of the world (Socrates, Buddha, Kant) were atheists. Ethics asks what the good life is, for human needs, but for the religious person the good life is defined by God, and so comes from divine, not human values. But either living based on one's own needs (ethics) or on God's is better than living for the collective; this is nationalism, ethnocentrism, and fascism. Unfortunately, such ethnonationalism has taken over much of the religious community - this for Leibowitz is the travesty of religious Zionism. Seeing the individual as being about the nation or the land is idolatry and fascism. He took a savage joy in smashing the idols of his generation - Zionism, the kibbutzim, millenarianism, Jewish chauvinism. (He called himself a Zionist for a very simple reason, that he wanted to live in a state ruled by Jews, but did not believe it had any higher purpose or world historical significance.)<br/><br/>For the religious Jew, all that counts is keeping <i>halacha</i>, and everything else is a distraction, not <i>lishmah</i>. Wanting reward, a state, the Messiah, prosperity, all of these are different types of invalid <i>shelo lishmas</i>, a concession to the weak. The last few essays discuss his very early opposition to the Occupation, and a bit about the relationship between Christianity and Judaism. He sees Christianity, unlike other faiths, as the polar opposite of Judaism, for only it claims to replace Judaism, making the continued existence of the Jewish communion a serious problem. Liberal Christians and liberal Jews are willing to overlook or change the tenets of their faith to overcome this, but he sees it as inauthentic.<br/><br/>My thoughts: I strongly identify with the danger of the state co-opting religion, with a Ministry of Religion and army rabbis which, as Ben Gurion told Leibowitz, allow the state to control and neuter religion as a social force. Equally bad for him is religion co-opting the state: it should be an independent forum for wrestling with Jewish ideas, not part of the state which comes cap in hand to Jews overseas.<br/><br/>Theologically, Leibowitz believed that Judaism is only for the few. But the many need something more to subsist on: It's hard to inspire Leibowitzian Jews to go to synagogue each morning. We may imagine Leibowitz as the bitter old man in synagogue who keeps going for his own psychological reasons but doesn't <i>enjoy</i> it, and won't inspire the youth to come (there were many such characters in my own childhood <i>shul</i>). People need something else. Whether Leibowitz is correct or not, his theology is precluded by design from mass appeal.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.3700000000000001,2019,12,983.0

On the food side Kurlansky spends a lot of time talking recipes and various salt derivatives: transporting salt as salted fish was common, and soy sauce emerged from this, as did Roman garum. Also discussed are sauerkraut, ketchup, and ""hundred-year-old-eggs"". Preserving the summer's harvest in salt was a village ritual in Northern Europe, lost as so much else of the grinding hard work and communality of premodern times, with the modern invention of canning and refrigeration. And it turns out that salt deposits are often adjacent to reservoirs of petroleum or natural gas, the burial site of ancient organisms - the Chinese were piping it through bamboo and using it to cook 2,000 years ago. Thus in a more high-tech age, our new essential commodity lies adjacent to the old.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.2599999999999998,2019,12,226.0

IRL this was...not exactly the case, although the world was captivated by tiny Finland's heroism. Russia was a world-class army (albeit one of the weaker ones), fighting a tiny, provincial, badly-equipped army. The question was only really if Finland could hold out long enough to embarrass the superpower and cause it to quit and sadly, despite an incredibly heroic turn, SPOILER <spoiler>this wasn't really the case</spoiler>. (A few decades later, the Vietnamese did this pretty well - perhaps the difference was that the rest of the world was at peace?) Russia basically did win on humiliating terms - gaining more territory than it had initially demanded, and which it <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelian_question"">still holds to this day</a> - but on the other hand it didn't manage to set up a Communist puppet government in Finland, as per its original plan. Also, Finland subsequently allied with Hitler to  fight the Russians during the ""continuation war"", perhaps understandable under the circumstances but as the kids say, not a good look.<br/><br/>Per this chatty and detailed history (which sometimes gets bogged down in military detail, and is light on the international diplomatic context), one of the key factors in the battle was homeland defense, both in terms of the Finns knowing and being used to the terrain, and in their level of motivation. Another was the benefits of democracy over authoritarianism. Russian commanders were scared to take decisions or speak their mind, and it was the arrival of the more independent-minded Timoshenko, who requested and received indemnity from failure from Stalin before taking the job, which saw the reversal of the Soviet fortunes. The power of good communications, which goes without saying in modern battles, also comes up: the Finns were frequently held back by bad radios systems, relying instead on runners.<br/><br/>Another lesson is the hypocrisy of the world community. They showed lots of sympathy for Finland, and even among Communists Soviet propaganda wasn't really successful, but most of the actual help sent was either useless (volunteer brigades with little training, including some people with wooden legs) or disguised self-interest (the Anglo-French plan to try capture the Finnish oil fields and cut off Germany, which would have done very little to help the Finns).<br/><br/>Lastly, a couple of anecdotes that stuck with me. Mannerheim, the heroic general who led the Finns, was an unreconstructed class snob who had a portrait of Tsar Nicholas II in his office (!) and didn't speak Finnish(!!) Also, the Finnish national characteristic of <i>sisu</i> (grit/resilience/stoicism), exemplified by the peasant woman told she would need to evacuate her house so troops could burn it down, who scrubbed and whitewashed it because ""when one gives a gift to Finland, one desires that it should be like new""; and the old man in the same situation who came back to check the soldiers had done a thorough enough job, adding that his grandfather and father had done the same thing in the face of Russian invasion.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.1500000000000004,2019,12,510.0

The first is the science biography, ""Oppie"" the prodigy growing up, a brilliant scientist-humanist, who develops the bomb and becomes a household name and symbol of science's Promethean power. Part 2 is a political biography. The combination of Oppenheimer's youthful flirtation with Communism and his postwar nuclear dovishness - combined with the fervid climate of McCarthyite witch-hunts - proved his downfall.

These events happened just five years earlier (1949), and the imbalance of power was much greater. In fact, it's questionable how much Oppenheimer suffered practically from the hearing (as opposed to psychologically). He could have opted out of it by choosing not to challenge the allegations, he was financially comfortable and over time his reputation grew to that of a scientific martyr.

The book opens in the late 60s, when it seemed like radical ideas might change the world, and revolution was just around the corner. That didn't happen, but there was something of a cultural victory. America, as Burroughs puts it, wanted the revolution, just not the violence. During what Tom Wolfe called the ""Me decade"" individualism and alternative lifestyles became commonplace, and American cities filled up with Afros, Hari Krishna and bell-bottoms.<br/><br/>Burroughs, perhaps best known as a business journalist (his book [b:Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco|781182|Barbarians at the Gate  The Fall of RJR Nabisco|Bryan Burrough|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442897076l/781182._SY75_.jpg|1011004] still sets the standard for the genre), tells an entertaining tale, beginning with the Weathermen (later swapped for the gender-neutral Weather Underground) splitting from the SDS and going underground. Their serious bombing career basically began and ended in a posh Manhattan townhouse (Dustin Hoffman lived next door) belonging to a member's parents. The bombmaker accidentally blew himself up, the cops arrived and the movement scattered underground. The leadership mostly spent their time underground living on a boat in California, getting handouts from sympathetic above-ground friends, generally not doing much to foment global revolution, and eventually ending up as trendy leftist activists, visiting Occupy and chilling with the Obamas. Essentially, WUers like Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn <i>were</i> a bunch of not very successful student radicals who mostly blew up toilets and didn't kill anyone.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there were more dangerous groups, like the Black Liberation Army who targeted cops and the Puerto Rico independence movement FLAN (Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña). One of the best stories in the book is that of FLAN bombmaker Willie Morales, who evades a huge police dragnet but is eventually captured after a bomb he is making blows off all his fingers and one eye. Dripping blood, he still manages to crawl over and flush his incriminating papers and turn on the gas in the hope of blowing up the police when they come. After his trial he broke out of a prison hospital by climbing down a rope which broke and falling two stories, and is currently living in Cuba and on the FBI's Most Wanted list.<br/><br/>Burroughs is probably a little too sympathetic to the cops. For example, he notes the irony of several senior FBI figures being indicted for extralegal activities like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bag_operation"">black bag jobs</a> (basically breaking in without a warrant), while WU figures like Dohrn went free, despite being connected with over 100 bombings. But Dohrn wasn't a bombmaker, nor was she shooting people on the street: in fact it is striking how small the toll on civilians was, perhaps why Americans were able to mostly ignore it. (Honestly it speaks pretty well of American society that its worst domestic terrorists felt really bad if their bombs would hurt ""innocents"" - they only wanted to attack the wealthy, the army or the police.) Whereas the FBI went way across the line, and even J. Edgar Hoover knew it, trying to cut back the illegality until pushed by Nixon. And Burroughs thinks the FBI covered up the vast majority of the illegality, and anyway nobody did serious time.

But also sharing tidbits from Marxist protests in Germany and Israel): the far left doesn't know how to win, no matter how much passion it has. The contemporary radical left seems much more subdued (one could hardly imagine Black Lives Matter bombing Congress, and not only because security has improved), and then as now has the tacit support of much of the young, educated upper class, working in big cities as programmers or lawyers, listening to <i>Chapo Trap House</i> and wearing DSA lapel pins. (And DJT is uncannily like Nixon repeated as farce!) The story of NYC's Lincoln Detox, a drug detox clinic run with city funding that taught Maoist literature and funneled money to the BLA until Ed Koch angrily shut it down seems a good exemplar of the book: it is mostly about almost comically out-of-touch Utopians, achieving nothing but offering no real menace to society.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.1200000000000001,2019,11,783.0

So much so that George Tenet, who presided over the agency during the Iraqi WMD fiasco, cited this Teddy Roosevelt quote in his retirement speech:<blockquote>It is not the critic who counts, nor the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.</blockquote>Sure, intelligence is difficult, and it's far easier to criticise in hindsight, but has the CIA really had any major successes at all? The inescapable conclusion of this book is no. Despite enormous investments, total secrecy and almost no accountability, the vast majority of the agency's history has been inept intelligence gathering and shambolic, illegal covert ops, which when successful has turned out to be ethically repugnant and actually harmful to America's interests. <br/><br/>Weiner is a high-level journalist who has interviewed many of the principals from more recent times, and the stories in this book are based mostly on declassified documents. One might still accuse him of cherry-picking, and yet the cumulative effect of all of these stories - Bay of Pigs and Guatemala and Indonesia and Iran and Vietnam and Laos and Iraq and on and on - is damning. It shows the beginnings of the CIA as an old-boys club of prep-school alcoholics, who created an image of a nonexistent golden age of acuity and bravado only through Allen Dulles' savvy PR, one still believed by much of the public. At the height of its power the CIA was bolstered by fraternal relations - Allen and (Secretary of State) John Foster Dulles, and later Jack and (AG) Bobby Kennedy. The Cold War's end brought about a loss of prestige and funding for the agency, and eventually a permanent downgrade in status. No-one really believes in analysts nowadays: suave Groton grads can't exactly blend in as CPAs in Tikrit, and the CIA won't take Arab-Americans if they have relatives in their countries of origin. Today everything is about information interception and big data processing; and surely the breathtaking scandals of the NSA, a few of which are already known, are yet to be told; once again, naturally, much too late.",,,2,,,0,,,,,,male,0.9100000000000001,2019,11,392.0

Trilling went deep into his Victorian world and came out writing like it; his sentences are rich and twisted and full of niche period references. Arnold wrote poems, a few of them famous, and a lot of criticism, but if you had to distill him to one idea it would be this: in contrast to Mill's liberalism (more common today) which claims that it's better to have a free marketplace of ideas and tolerate the bad along with the good; we need a positive liberalism, a vision of excellence which unites and elevates the nation, something in place of religion which provides moral succour and artistic inspiration, rather than settling for the pablum of democratic popular culture and ideas. It is this that Arnold calls ""culture"" writ large. Trilling doesn't always agree with his ideas, and occasionally pushes back strongly (as in the case of race science - the book was published in 1939).<br/><br/>Matthew Arnold's father Thomas was famous as the schoolmaster at Rugby who transformed a failing institution. As a young man Arnold rebelled somewhat against his serious, pious milieu and lived as a dandy, growing his hair long and befriending Parisian actresses. But when it came, his poetry was surprisingly grave, dealing with ennui of modern times, disenchantment, longing for classical serenity; and with the injustice in the world, love, fear of death. The last part of the book deals with his desire to establish a watered-down basis for Christianity, something which one couldn't really believe while taking orders - for Arnold could say Christianity is all kinds of good, useful, desirable, everything except true - but one which could give solace to someone who'd already taken them, who could see a lot of the prayers non-literally, and work for justice. Which is the other theme: the increasing enfranchisement (and dissatisfaction) of the working class, and Arnold's desire to bring them under the wing of the national Church, while in return reforming some of its unchristian and reactionary embrace of the titled class.<br/><br/>Beginning with confusion and poetry, moving to social criticism, and ending in faith: Arnold's trajectory was not uncommon for his time - the 19th century saw a strong religious revival in parts of Europe - but it was on the way out. His attitudes seemed dated even to his contemporaries, and today he is less known for his ideals as for his superb, clear prose.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.1200000000000001,2019,10,406.0

Through several decades of what Dirac called ""lots of first rate work done by second-rate minds"", the concept has been experimentally confirmed in incredibly accurate ways. This Very Short Intro is pretty good, considering the philosophical approaches and containing very little (but not zero) maths. Below are my (lightly edited) notes.<br/><br/>The story begins with the ""ultraviolet crisis"" in statistical mechanics. Light was well understood by Maxwell's equation as an electromagnetic wave propagated in the luminiferous (ie ""light-bearing"" aether), solved with Partial Differential Equations. Except then you have black body radiation, which the theory predicted to be infinite(!!) at higher frequencies! Bohr realised that it made sense if you saw light as being emitted in quanta - really like a particle. But then is it a wave or a particle? Hold that thought.<br/><br/>Then with electrons you also have issues. Thompson imagined that you had a big positive charge studded with electrons, the plum-pudding model. But then they bombarded an atom with alpha-waves which bounced back! That made sense if you imagine that actually all the mass is concentrated in the centre, like a solar system. But then wait: why don't all the electrons crash into the centre? The answer is Pauli's exclusion principle, the electrons don't like to be in the same state or place (this is because they are fermions, unlike light particles (photons) which are bosons, which <i>do</i> like to cluster in one place, which is why we have lasers and also explains some of the conducting effects of crystals). In some sense not only is light (waves) actually a particle, but electrons (definitely a particle, right?) are in fact also waves!<br/><br/>Here you have the double-slit experiment: as Feynman said if you meditate on this you have the whole puzzle of QM. Fire a light beam at two slits and you have an interference pattern, because they are waves interfering with each other and on average hitting the centre between the two slits. But fire just one electron and it hits dead opposite the slit, so why do a cluster of them land in the middle? Well this is the wave-particle duality which we still don't have a good answer for, there is Copenhagen idea of complementarity (it is both, very Zen), the theory that electrons are particles that also have shadow waves of potential, Everitt's Multiple Worlds, a similar theory of multiple minds, plus various other theories. Talks a bit about the philosophical implications. Wheeler had this ""delayed choice"" <i>Gedankenexperiment</i> where you measure it after it's fired, so it changes path in mid-flight - trippy! Is it human minds measuring that affects things? What about cats or earthworms, what about computers?<br/><br/>There is a bit of the mathematics - Heisenberg used matrix algebra to solve QM, whereas Schrödinger used more conventional PDE but it comes out the same. Dirac theorised positrons, electrons are gaps that pop into existence in  a sea of positive charge. Decoherence - the way it becomes macroscopic.<br/><br/>EPR asked what if two particles become quantum entangled, generated in such a way that examining the one will affect the other - can this information travel faster than the speed of light? Answer is yes! This is the concept of ""action at a distance"", accepted by Newton, made unnecessary by Maxwell and Einstein, but now revived. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.18000000000000016,2019,10,584.0

Putting aside its ramifications, we can successfully model this in a way that fits all experimental evidence. But how do we <i>picture</i> it? That more philosophical question still hasn't a satisfactory answer. The venerable Copenhagen Interpretation defended by Bohr is based around the principle of ""complementarity"" - that there is one identity, and it is determined by the observer. (Does the observer have to be human? What about a daemon? We don't know.) The other school of thought is Everett's Multiple World Hypothesis, as science fictional as it sounds.<br/><br/>The two men featured in this book, Wheeler and Feynman, took very different views to this type of question. Wheeler was a philosopher and dreamer with a dramatic turn of phrase (he coined ""wormhole"" and ""sum over paths"", and made ""black hole"" famous) who attracted a lot of cranks late in his life. Feynman was a pragmatic tinkerer who loved practical jokes, bongo drums and teaching and had little interest in philosophical questions. The book describes the friendship between the patrician Wheeler and the flamboyant, Queens-accented Feynman, which is, fundamentally, not so exciting? Both were brilliant and they got on straight away. But Halpern is really telling the story of the quantum revolution from the 1930s-60s, in the shadow of Pauli, Bohr, Hesienberg, Schroedinger, and the oddball Dirac. (""He's another Dirac, but normal!"" was one comment about Feynman.) <br/><br/>As pop science it suffers from a common failing of the genre: adamant not to use any maths, Halpern is forced into describing things in increasingly vague and nonsensical ways, often resorting to folksy analogies that obscure more than they enlighten; as when discussing Hamiltonians he gives a simple metaphor explaining what a derivative is and moves on. Still, I enjoyed it. It made some things a bit clearer for me, and conveys some of Wheeler's sense of wonder and Feynman's infectious joy.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.0700000000000003,2019,10,349.0

The history of beer for most people is not a serious topic of study. It seems to them frivolous and hardly worth more than a few diverting minutes of anyone’s time. Beer, after all, is a drink for leisure, for young people, generally men, and associated with sports and student life. That perception of beer is a case of historical myopia, of an inability of many people at the beginning of the twenty-first century to conceive of a world different from their own. The prevailing presentism makes it difficult for many to comprehend a world where beer was a necessity, a part of everyday life, a drink for everyone of any age or status, and a beverage for all times of the day from breakfast to dinner and into the evening.</blockquote>Unger covers the development of beer mainly around the time of professionalisation, after a brief overview of the ancient history of beer (various intoxicating beverages were known to the ancients, but malted beer seems to originate in Sumer). In this period brewing went from women's work to a male industry. The great innovation, the fulcrum of the book, was the switch to hops as a bittering agent instead of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruit"">gruit</a>. Also the German Reinheitsgebot, which, uh, indicates that the history of beer isn't edge-of-your-seat stuff. There might be some fun stories here, but Unger is mainly interested in the economics: a lot about taxation, guilds, trade and consumption statistics, and regulation. <br/><br/>The story ends with beer being upstaged by newer drinks like brandy and better wines, and the modern technological innovation, where we can brew consistent good beer year round in any climate with artificial refrigeration.

Only at the end of this book does Farmelo shift from telling-great-Dirac-stories mode (the tales are legion, and really are great) and consider whether he was some type of autistic, and maybe we really ought not to laugh at him. Like - and it hurts me to type this - a real life Sheldon from  The Nerd Show, he was painfully literal, uninterested in small talk, and singlemindedly focused on physics and maths. <br/><br/>Farmelo, a theoretical physics PhD and professional science populariser, gives a fairly light treatment of Dirac's physics work but is masterful in untangling the pathology of the expanded Dirac family. Dirac <i>père</i> was friendly to his son but treated his wife with contempt and cruelty, and possibly drove his eldest son - eclipsed by his genius younger brother - to take his own life. Both Dirac parents attempted to keep up a relationship with their son through cheerful letters as his fame increased, and tried to see him, but he kept them at a distance and wrote ice-cold letters. (He wrote a few sentences about Cambridge weather one week, omitting the fact that he had been made a fellow of the Royal Society.)<br/><br/>The move from relativity to quantum physics included a change from a world just barely imaginable with real-world parallels (the bowling ball on the bedsheet, say) to one based in mathematical models which makes no sense in macroscopic terms but somehow align with experimental data. Einstein is said to have been an intuitive thinker, who picked up maths only on a need-to-know basis. Despite early training as an engineer, Dirac loved maths, and it was his mathematically informed quantum ideas that formed the basis for the new field. (His textbook was considered a classic of clarity and beauty for many years.) <br/><br/>Farmelo considers that his desire for mathematically beauty in theories led him to reject the newer ideas in quantum electrodynamics and that like his idol Einstein, he probably wasted the latter half of his career (the so-called ""Nobel curse""). He married Eugene Wigner's sister Manci (an odd but seemingly pleasant marriage) and moved to Florida. But still he remained perhaps the second-most influential physicist of the 20th century, a strange and lonely man who will be remembered for centuries to come.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.1299999999999999,2019,9,388.0

The ""masters"" of the title are Johns Carmack and Romero, and Kushner's characterisation of them is excellent (though the book is thin on technical content). Carmack is monk-like, a programming prodigy, who pushed the industry forward with innovations like ray tracing and binary space partitioning. Romero is the overgrown child who lives to play and design games, trashtalk, and generally hog the limelight. When they met Romero was the better programmer, but Carmack quickly caught up and the two formed a fruitful partnership based around their respective strengths: Carmack building the engine, Romero playing with it and designing levels. After they eventually <spoiler> split up, their strengths and weaknesses become clear: Carmack leads a lean, efficient but dull workplace, shipping impressive software but creatively bereft. ""No-one cares about story,"" he says, not quite accurately.

The main issue of criticism is how to determine good from bad - what constitutes a ""good read"", say, and how do we identify it? On some level this is a question for the branch of philosophy called Aesthetics, which Wellek dives into where he must, though understandably seeing that as outside his already large scope. One conclusion might be total relativism, which is basically embraced by this site - everyone shares their own tastes - and perhaps by the industry more broadly, as ousted <i>New York</i> book critic Christian Lorentzen argued earlier this years <a href=""https://harpers.org/archive/2019/04/like-this-or-die/"">in <i>Harper's</i></a> (discussed in a symposium <a href=""https://bookmarks.reviews/the-book-review-is-dead-long-live-the-book-review/"">here</a>). But most people understand there to be a broad sense that some books <i>are</i> better than others, that there is a difference between the great and the merely pleasurable, and that it is the role of critics to figure that out. Leaving the conundrum of how that can be to the philosophers, we back out and ask merely <i>what is good?</i> The answer to that is the history of criticism.  <br/><br/>Wellek reads at least half a dozen languages and is conversant with the literary traditions of the big European nations. He is also an insanely clear writer - something happened to academic literary theory soon after this came out (was it Derrida's infamous Johns Hopkins conference?) that made the field a lot less accessible to dilettantes like myself. He begins with the inheritance of Aristotle's [b:Poetics|13270|Poetics|Aristotle|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520340549l/13270._SY75_.jpg|2301058], the three classical unities which European writers and critics, especially the French, tried to hold by, while admitting exceptions for genius. He understands the idea behind this as being related to the suspension of disbelief, one possible vision of the dramatic experience. But by the mid-18th century, the period in which this book begins, that was already showing signs of strain. <br/><br/>Running through French thinkers like Voltaire and Diderot, Wellek then covers Dr Johnson in England and a host of minor English aestheticians, before devoting the rest of the volume to German movements - <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, Goethe's wild vision of nature united with the Classical world, Kant and then Schiller, whose influential essay <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Na%C3%AFve_and_Sentimental_Poetry"">On Naive and Sentimental Poetry</a> contrasted the primitive (naive) poet with his modern, self-aware counterpart, setting the stage for the Romanticists who followed. I wish I'd taken better notes as I read, as a lot of the ideas swirl together even now. <br/><br/>Reading this and seeing the flow of opinions - Neoclassicism, Didacticism, Romanticism, Art for Art's Sake - helped give me a sense of what critics try to do when they set a frame of reference for what a work should be, where it succeeds or falls flat. There is always a hidden matrix of assumptions about what we should expect from art and why we enjoy it. The answer to those questions are subjective, and change from generation to generation, but it our task as readers and critics to be aware of them.<br/><br/>End-note: a friend found this book on the street and gave it to me.

It focuses narrowly on its topic, and assumes familiarity with things like Pride's Purge and bridewells, and wastes zero words explaining its political background:  the appointment of Cromwell as protector of the Commonwealth, and later Charles II's Restoration. Luckily the story of this period, and specifically the <i>kulturkampf</i> over ""godly Reformation"" is fascinating (also luckily, Wikipedia exists). The Puritans and other Nonconformists had suffered persecution for a long time, and with the Commonwealth's founding they began trying to implement a Bible-based theocracy, cancelling Easter and Christmas(!), punishing people who desecrated the Sabbath with things like taking walks for pleasure, and generally being the fun-hating zealots popular culture remembers them as. The general view of things is that their Reformation failed and the people gleefully accepted the return of the Stuarts (and began writing the bawdiest of theatrical comedies). Capp's thesis is: not quite. Bringing a myriad of colourful, delightful details from the period, he portrays a fragile state whose representatives were nonetheless able to achieve quite a lot in repressing their religious rivals (such so-called ""white sinners"" took precedence for them over the pedestrian fornicating/cursing/ale-drinking ""black sinners"") and laid the ground for their toleration in England in the coming centuries. Many Presbyterian preachers were able to find common ground with the religious revival of the Puritans, and even some Cavalier aristocrats were won over to Cromwell fandom. (One such erected a statue of Cromwell in his garden; after the Restoration he moved it to his basement.) Although not successful in their aim of establishing a state in concord with the Bible, the Puritans left a strong mark on English culture that lasted well beyond the Reformation. But the bulk of this book is an image of a hard-drinking, bull-baiting, Sabbath-cricket-playing people's resistance to a godly Reformation they had neither asked for nor desired.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.43000000000000016,2019,8,311.0

From the pious Padre to the romantic poet Fleury to the scientific positivist Collector, ideologies in general seem to come off as useless cargo cults, trying to explain a world shaped by much greater forces. There are glimpses of the idea that it is only the Indians, with their stoic acceptance of poverty and pagan rituals, who are able to face up to reality; all thoughts of human betterment are mirages. Farrell never tries to integrate the story into the postcolonial narrative of India, and it generally feels a bit uneven at times. (A first-person narrator appears suddenly, just once, near the end, surely an editorial oversight.) He wrote two other novels, about Ireland and Singapore, and at the very least was able to channel the futility of colonialism into satisfying stories.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.9100000000000001,2019,7,184.0

On the first count they advance numerous arguments from bonobos and various isolated communities. They argue for a Rousseauvian view of the human condition, where premodern life was healthier, safer and more peaceful, <i>contra</i> Steven Pinker. I find it hard to decide in this case: their evidence might be as cherry-picked as that of those they critique, and the entire field has always seemed to me a frame on which to hang voguish prejudices without much need for (or possibility of) evidence. Making this worse is the fact that this book is clearly aimed at laypeople, with constant hokey jokes and analogies, so I will give the authors some leeway here: maybe they have just dumbed the material down to my level. <br/><br/>But the second part, the argument for a more enlightened view towards monogamy and human sexuality in general, is what will have drawn most readers. I wish the authors had been more specific about what they recommend. For much of the book it sounds as if the solution to our sexual maladies is nothing short of a ""bonobofication"", with constant large orgies and free-flowing, temporary pairings. This seems in many ways to agree with our sexual instincts. Yet rather than exploring the contemporary scene of sexual reinvention, as surveyed by Emily Witt, for example, in her excellent [b: Future Sex|22929486|Future Sex|Emily Witt|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437460387l/22929486._SX50_.jpg|42499040] (<i>Sex at Twilight</i>?), they pull back, criticising the soft target of hypocritically moralistic Evangelical politicians, and arguing merely for the forgiving, Continental approach to late-stage infidelity advocated by Esther Perel (in [b: The State of Affairs|34017010|The State of Affairs  Rethinking Infidelity|Esther Perel|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1495687620l/34017010._SY75_.jpg|55014433]). <br/><br/>My own view is sceptical. While the shortcomings of monogamous, bourgeois, heterosexual relationships are apparent, the goal of fulfillment through sexual liberation seems rather like an ever-receding libidinal shore. Reports from those who living radically non-normative sexual lifestyles (as recorded by Witt, say) make it seem - though not clearly worse than the alternative - not a panacea. People simply continue to experience ennui, insecurity, lack of fulfillment.  And while I applaud continued experiments - which have lately yielded the surprising but welcome social compromise of boring, middle-class LGBT couples - I believe that our greatest long-term fulfillment will still be found in the world of the mind and spirit, not that of the body.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,2.01,2019,7,422.0

People like me tend to overthink things and thus don't see much point in negotiating: either I'm wrong, and no negotiation will change that, or I'm right, and simply need to inform the counterparty. There are aspects of life which <i>do</i> work this rationally. For these there is game theory, which quantifies the maximum utility move for each side. But people are irrational, and so most things in life are negotiation, which is about psychology.<br/><br/>This is essentially a toolkit for winning people to your point of view, an updated, more zero-sum version of [b:How to Win Friends and Influence People|4865|How to Win Friends and Influence People|Dale Carnegie|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442726934l/4865._SY75_.jpg|2370171].

Mann uses the dual paradigm of the ""wizard"" (Norman Borlaug, creator of the Green Revolution) and ""prophet"" (William Vogt, godfather of the modern environmentalist movement) to explore a fundamental question: are we doomed to run out of resources, making our planet uninhabitable (for us), and die out? This seems to be the path of every species, and after all our resources are finite. After fascinating biographies of the two men, Mann considers the question in terms of the four elements - earth (food), water, fire (energy), and air (climate change).<br/><br/>The prophets' argument is the more intuitive one, so maybe it's worth mentioning that of the wizards. The scientist Warren Weaver (a man of many talents) had the idea of thinking of food scarcity in terms of physics and chemistry, not biology. People need energy to survive, which we convert into nutrients. The energy comes from nuclear reactions - primarily the one happening in the sun. Plants are good at converting that into energy. The sun provides enough energy to support scores of billions of people, as many as we have space for (though we probably don't want to get to that sardine-world - but we're very far from it). The problem is just an engineering one: developing more efficient ways of converting this energy.<br/><br/>A good example of this is the Haber-Bosch process, maybe the most important technological development of the 20th century. Today it uses 1% of the world's energy supply, and roughly doubles food output, changing billions of lives. At the same time, nitrogen runoff from all the extra fertilizer is a massive environmental issue - if not for climate change, Mann suggests, it would probably be seen as the biggest. In a similar vein he considers issues of water, energy and climate. He tries to thread the needle with climate change, encouraging skeptics to accept the scientific fact that it is happening, while noting that because of the literally incalculable complexity of the global climate, it can be hard to say with certainty what the extent and effects of climate change will be - it could be less bad, or worse, than we expect. He also considers a moral question of how much we owe to generations of the future.<br/><br/>Mann ultimately is unsure if we will make it, if the wizards or the prophets are correct. But he is an erudite and compassionate writer*. This is a gripping book, and an urgently needed insight in our age of environmental doom.<br/> <br/>*Minor annoyance: he has the habit of remarking on ""uneuphonious"", clunky names (which, in chemistry and molecular biology, is most of them...)",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.7599999999999998,2019,7,448.0

As I understand it, Japan's imperial family had held largely symbolic power until the Emperor Meiji, who was restored in place of the Tokugawa Shogunate, beginning a rapid modernisation of the country which included greatly heightened respect for the Emperor as both religious and temporal leader. Meiji was succeeded by Hirohito's father, the Emperor Taishō, who had a weak reign marked by increasing unrest and desire for democracy (as well as the formation of a robust Communist Party). Groomed from a young age to rule and preserve the dynasty, Hirohito began his regency just 9 years into his father's rule.<br/><br/>Bix is an old-school Chomskian leftist, and his - not uncontroversial - thesis is that Hirohito was a driving force behind Japan's militarism, pushing into more and more aggressive positions, even when it was clear the war was lost; and that he was whitewashed by General MacArthur in order to uphold a traditionalist barrier against Communism.* Writing during the 90s, Bix was able to access a lot of declassified information from the war, although there is still very little information available. It does seem that the Emperor had final say over strategic decisions, and would never have been overridden, something General Tojo (who took the bulk of the blame, and was sentenced to death by the tribunal) mentioned during his trial. (He retracted it the next day.) While he may not have been responsible for the atrocities in Nanjing and the POW camps, Hirohito was, in Bix's view, the force behind Japanese aggression, its continued offensive in the Pacific far beyond defensible lines (eventually reaching Australia), and refusal to surrender earlier to the US. After the postwar rehabilitation, the people accepted a whitewashed story of the Emperor as a pacifist, led astray by the ""militarist cliques"", a man of culture and science, who led his people (albeit only as a constitutional monarch, but still retaining much of his prewar honour) to decades of moral rehabilitation and prosperity.<br/><br/>This isn't a history of Japans' war (many major historical events of the period get a page or less), but a portrait of one man, deeply researched and at times sympathetic, but ultimately damning. Bix is critical of American military overreach, and the Japanese neoconservatism of Shinzō Abe's LDP. Hirohito's son Akihito abdicated a few months ago in place of his son Naruhito, beginning the Reiwa era. But ignorance of the war past still lingers, and as China increasingly threatens America's Pacific dominance, miltarism in Japan will probably only rise. <br/><br/>*There is a precedent here: MacArthur was a militarist Republican who openly spatted with Truman before eventually being fired, precipitating a constitutional crisis. Truman later said ""I fired him because he wouldn’t respect the authority of the President.

As befits a product of the University of Chicago economics department, he is a true believer in free enterprise and market solutions, and has some questions about anthropogenic climate change. (He wavers on this last, but in his defense he firmly advocates policies to reduce carbon emissions.) <br/><br/>When he finally comes down to brass tacks, though, Glaeser has some good ideas backed by compelling arguments. He has good things to say about Jane Jacobs, but thinks she was overly fond of the low buildings of Greenwich Village: a charming urban treasure in itself, but not one that can be reproduced at scale. Noting that dense cities are far greener than sprawling ones (don't even mention suburbs*) he recommends building upwards and investing in public transport. Cars should pay a congestion tax that reflects their real cost to others, and cities shouldn't allow NIMBY preservationists to block new construction. It is an indictment of this self-serving mentality, often found in avowedly progressive places, that the four most expensive regions in the US in terms of house prices are <a href=""https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/18/these-are-the-most-expensive-counties-in-the-u-s-to-rent-hint-theyre-all-in-the-bay-area/"">San Francisco County, San Mateo County, Marin County and Santa Clara County</a>, the epicenter of Silicon Valley, and the place where poor people seeking a new start would most want to relocate. This is not due to a surfeit of demand, but to restricted supply, since population density in these areas is relatively low. <br/><br/>Glaeser favourably compares former London mayor Ken Livingstone with Prince Charles, who promotes environmental protection through his atavistic construction of a rural village, Poundbury. This would surely be an environmental boon if its residents were willing to live like 16th century serfs; but seeing as they will want central heating, and culture/entertainment a car-journey away, it ends up being much less green. As the masses of the developing world begin to expect a higher standard of living, Glaeser warns, only well-planned, dense cities can provide it without a concomitant environmental catastrophe. But before it can preach, the West should get its own house in order.<br/><br/>* Glaeser cheerfully confesses that he ended up moving to one, blaming the policy failures which made it irresistible: the overly generous mortgage interest income deduction (which encourages buying a bigger house) and the lack of investment in urban schools, which are generally inferior to their suburban counterparts.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.9,2019,6,410.0

His was a classic story of tough steppe nomads raiding decadent city dwellers - except that he was innovative, adaptive, fast and organised enough to create the biggest ever land empire, conquering more in 25 years than Rome did in 400. The Mongol army perfected the swarm formation, overrunning armies even when severely outnumbered, and honed Chinese siege tactics to the point where they permanently ended the walled cities era. (Although illiterate, Genghis respected knowledge, drafting engineers for combat and writers for propaganda.) Yes, the wave of Mongol conquest caused death and displacement to many, but they were fair rulers and once ensconced ushered in a century of Pax Mongolica (or Tatarica), leading to a wave of globalisation (that included the first global plague, the Black Death). Europe had its mind opened - Chaucer mentions him, and the art of the Renaissance wouldn't have been possible without Asian influence from the Silk Road. When Columbus set out he was looking for a route to Cathay, not knowing that the Mongol (Yuan) dynasty had been overthrown for 150 years! <br/><br/>Tamerlane, a distant descendant, really <i>was</i> unusually brutal and called himself a Mongol, which caused some of the bad reputation. Enlightenment writers also reappropriated half-forgotten medieval Mongolphobia. Voltaire used Genghis as the example of an evil autocrat because he couldn't use Louis XV. Things went up a notch  during the age of eugenics, with ""pan-mongolism"" used as a synonym for the ""yellow peril"", the original Dr Down theorising ""mongoloid"" genes as the cause for the syndrome he named, and vicious Soviet repression. <br/><br/>In an afterword, Weatherford tells the tale of the missing banner of Genghis Khan, preserved for centuries but lost during the Soviet persecutions. An anthropologist, he studied the original Mongol chronicle known as the ""Secret History"", travelled to the locations it mentioned, froze in the winters, and drank yak yoghurt. His admiration for Mongol culture is unfeigned, but his story bases itself in facts. Seeing the Mongol Empire's strengths - its pluralism, moderation, and fairness - is an important corrective to fearful and ignorant European half-memories of marauding hordes that persist in our collective imaginary.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.03000000000000025,2019,6,454.0

In a lesson in the nature of public scandal, Bell suffered almost no consequences for <i>Greenstar</i>, its creepy system of secretly and illegally recording millions of calls (it ""just <i>sounds</i> illegal"", said one CEO of the company). But a spate of personnel scandals and antitrust suits brought about the company's demise. The story ends with the dawn of Bulletin Board Systems, the internet-based community boards which provided the same type of hacker camaraderie. Most of the phreaks went on to become computer programmers, including Steves Jobs and Wozniak. <br/><br/>A good modern parallel might be file sharing on BitTorrent or the binary message boards of otherwise moribund Usenet. Originally, like phone phreaking, hackers did it for fun, but then everyone got wind of it and started using it to steal, and the lawyers came in (in this case with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act"">DMCA</a>). And this also led to the modern field of cybersecurity: if it's hackable, suggests Lapsley - and it is- better to let the curious play with it and find the holes.

I would have preferred to have found this quote before reading this book, but the introduction to my edition does warn that this is aimed at trained economists. Much of it went over my head, but I'll summarise the points that I got.<br/><br/>Keynes' starting point is the classically liberal economic tradition in which he was changed, and he comes to explain the times in which doesn't seem to work out IRL. He uses the metaphor of a Euclidean geometer meeting non-Euclidian parallels that meet, and berating them. People aren't always rational, he says: workers won't ever take a (nominal) pay cut, but they will take a cut in real wages. <br/><br/>Saving is not the same as investment - consumption goes back to labour, but saving does not always. As a society grows richer, people save more, harder to tempt them to consume since they have a lot (in terms of utility/money) already.<br/><br/>He quotes Mandeville's Fable of the Bees. Counterintuitively, it may be that what is sound financial advice for a household (spend less than you earn) isn't sound for a nation. If people don't spend, the economy suffers. This is the rest of Europe's complain against German <i>sparpolitik</i>: Germany's exemplary budget surpluses lead to trade deficits and asset bubbles in its neighbours (more on <a href=""https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/03/08/1552021202000/Alphachat--Is-the-eurozone-fixable--/"">this podcast</a>). Effective demand depends on people's constraints and beliefs about the future. Reverse of Say's Law obtains: demand creates supply. Thus better to bury money in the ground and let the free market dig it up, same as finding gold. Though obviously housing or something is better.<br/><br/>Investment as speculation. Beauty contest, not who you think prettiest, or who you think the public would think, but who you think other investors will pick, and it can even go to the fourth or fifth degree. No-one can enjoy investing who doesn't have a bit of the gambler's instinct, but then you pay its price. He jokes that it might not be bad to force people to hold for life.<br/><br/>One of the key points is that fiscal demand stimulus is necessary because of the limitations of monetary policy. Governments can change their interest rates but this has limited effect (as well as a lower bound), and if they are bound to a gold standard it can quickly become a fiasco. The ""real"", natural interest rate is determined by economic conditions. Monetarism, championed by Friedman (who distanced himself from ""naive Keynesianism"") claims that the supply of money determines interest rates. So one must prevent people saving it. Not eating dinner is not a commitment to eating dinner another night, it is just a reduction of demand.<br/><br/>Since gold is deflationary, we need to build a publicly owned green cheese factory and convince people it has value (fiat money).<br/><br/>Marshall thinks the historical lack of savings (the small amount people have stored up after so many centuries) is because of the human desire for instant gratification. Keynes thinks it's because of high liquidity premiums (costs a lot to own land/money, more than interest).<br/><br/>At the end are some comments on mercantilism with interesting historical background (and more my speed). He cites the thoughts of Locke and Hume on currency, value of money determined by liquidity preference. Urges that return on capital should be kept low (the ""euthanasia of the rentier"") in order to create full employment and head off social instability (writing during 1936.) Ends with the thought that ideas take a while to percolate because most people don't absorb new ideas after 25-30, but that ultimately “it is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.”",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.8399999999999999,2019,4,629.0

Some are concerned that this will hit poorer residents more, or on the flip side that wealthy suburbanites will try to block the law. Amazon and Uber are reportedly in favour. As things were in 1961, so today: cities present hard problems, committees provide fixes, and no-one is pleased with the result.<br/><br/>Or is that so? Reading the first half of this book made me a bit frustrated. Jacobs became famous for fighting down Robert Moses' attempts to bulldoze whole neighbourhoods in his insatiable pursuit of building highways. Clearly history has vindicated her, I thought, but her image of city planning is anchored in her own place and time. But from the beginning of Part 4, it becomes clear that Jacobs is well aware of how contingent her advice is on her particular circumstances, and she suggests some more general principles on how to tackle the problems of our own time. I liked this quote in particular:<br/><br/><blockquote>It is understandable that men who were young in the 1920’s were captivated by the vision of the freeway Radiant City, with the specious promise that it would be appropriate to an automobile age. At least it was then a new idea; to men of the generation of New York’s Robert Moses, for example, it was radical and exciting in the days when their minds were growing and their ideas forming. Some men tend to cling to old intellectual excitements, just as some belles, when they are old ladies, still cling to the fashions and coiffures of their exciting youth. But it is harder to understand why this form of arrested mental development should be passed on intact to succeeding generations of planners and designers. It is disturbing to think that men who are young today, men who are being trained now for their careers, should accept <i>on the grounds that they must he “modern” in their thinking</i>, conceptions about cities and traffic which are not only unworkable, but also to which nothing new of any significance has been added since their fathers were children.</blockquote><br/><br/>Jacobs criticises those who would take her literally (planning, say, an actual ""grocery store on each corner"".) She opposes the idea of rational, top-down planning - that of Le Corbusier, Ebenezer Howard's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement"">Garden City Movement</a>, or Robert Moses - and praises existing cities. Many of her ideas have been absorbed into our common sense. She was right about the wastefulness of planning for cars, and the cruelty and pointlessness of clearing slums instead of improving them. She advocated density, and described the mysterious alchemy of vibrant city neighborhoods. We have better cities today, and slum-clearing is no longer practiced. But how might we learn from 1950s Greenwich Village to, say, Nairobi or Singapore? What stances should we take on NIMBYism in San Francisco, Amazon's mooted move to Queens, or planning cities around autonomous vehicles? And how do we understand the puzzle of gentrification - why do rich residents sometimes drive out poor ones, and sometimes the opposite? Bikes are commonly seen today as a cure-all, but Jacobs points out that they have issues too. There is no alternative, she insists, to constant rethinking. <br/><br/>I grew up in Johannesburg, a city in which the downtown was known as the CBD (Central Business District) and was a hollowed-out, dangerous place. Jacobs points out the significance of this change of name, which epitomises the way planners miss the point of a vibrant urban space. ""Downtown is for people"" as her famous essay title put it. <br/><br/>The final chapter is fascinating and somewhat speculative. She quotes an essay by Warren Weaver (erstwhile collaborator with Claude Shannon on Information Theory) describing the progress of science from single/dual variable problems to multivariable problems. Scientists deal with these in different ways. In random systems (unorganised complexity), we use statistical mechanics. But in nonrandom ones, such as biological organisms (organised complexity), we can understand them only by finding the underlying causal mechanisms. She urges the application of the latter type of thinking to social and behavioural sciences, including urban planning. Ebenezer Howard was a Romantic who saw cities as alien to human nature, so his goal was to hide them with big green spaces to make them feel as much as possible like the country. Whereas in fact, Jacobs says, cities <i>are</i> natural, they are the natural living method of humans. Density is much better for the human and natural environment, and far more natural than sprawl attempting to recreate wildness (*cough* suburbia! But that's another story.)",,,1,,,0,,,,,,female,0.3099999999999996,2019,4,778.0

So this book is naturally stylish and literary throughout.

Although his writing would always look back to it - in the finest detail imaginable - he felt somewhat estranged from it, and was not an ardent Irish nationalist (though he did at least dislike the British). His tender marriage to Nora Barnacle began in Trieste (then part of Austria), where Joyce quickly acclimatised to Italian ways. His dominant mode may be summed up as a love of language, rhyme and wordplay, spilling over from English into other European languages and eventually the invented; a deep interest in describing the mind's interior; and certain themes - sex, guilt, masochism, religious misgivings. <br/><br/>I read [b: Ulysses|338798|Ulysses|James Joyce|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428891345s/338798.jpg|2368224] years ago, knowing nothing about its background or even the bare bones of Homer's story (barely recognisable, but still helpful). I was mostly confused, occasionally enraptured. I think that wasn't the best idea, and that some background (this biography, perhaps, or a guide) would have helped, but I also think that to try understand every word is besides the point. It may be doable with Ullyses, though certainly not with Work in Progress (dramatically revealed in 1939 as [b: Finnegans Wake|11013|Finnegans Wake|James Joyce|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336408055s/11013.jpg|322098]), but to love Joyce must surely be to connect to his games, his love of assonance and rhyme, to rrrroll the tongue and lips over the words gushing out, riverrun...

Greene is a competent writer (though ugh, his cheesy TV analogies were not needed), and Smart Science Guy straight out of Central Casting - a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, a happily married vegetarian and accomplished pianist. Less of a character than Feynman with his bongo drums and strip club visits.<br/><br/>Anyway. Some notes I took:<br/><br/>The book starts off with the idea of relativity. We generally associate it with Einstein but it goes back to Newton. Newton said ""I won't define space and time since their meaning is known to everyone"". As he has it, constant motion is indistinguishable from stationarity, (unless you can see...) in terms of the laws of motion. So if you're in total darkness can't tell if you're moving. However you CAN tell if you're accelerating - if your *velocity* is changing. You cam feel it. Why? It's an interesting question, and a very important one, as we'll see later.<br/><br/>if all motion is only noticeable as motion relative to something, what is the universal space all motion is relative to? One suggestion is that it's just ""space' - that's what Newton assumed. But that's kind of weird. What is space/is the universe inside of it/ is there any meaning to space if there is nothing in it? It's like an alphabet with no letters, is that still a thing? Surely it only has meaning because of what it contains? Leibniz suggested that space couldn't exist because then God would have to choose a point within it to put the universe, which would be arbitrary, and everything God does has a reason. Sounds very theological but in a scientific way we can pose the same question. So is there is no such thing as space?<br/><br/>Another possibility was posited by Mach, and it rocked the world of physics. That everything has motion relative to the amount of matter in the universe. If there was almost nothing, motion would be very slight. Until the current amount of mass, and current laws of motion. Lenin wrote a philosophical essay about this while in exile. If so maybe there is no way to tell if you're moving, except relative to other objects!<br/><br/>Maxwell/Einstein<br/>Maxwell realised that electricity and magnetism are same force. Also, light is just electromagnetic radiation! Speed of light was constant, same as speed of this force propagating in a field. But what does light move through? They assumed all forces move within something, so called it the ether after the Aristotelian term (an antecedent of modern ethernet cables also!)<br/><br/>The problem is that light should then have different speed depending on if you're moving towards or away from it. But Michelson/Morley couldn't find any change. They had some weird theories about it but none of them held up.<br/><br/>Einstein came along and suggested an amazing idea. If light moves at constant speed, time must be relative when you speed up, and movement through space and time must also be connected!! Just like if you are moving north and then turn slightly northwestward your west movement takes away from your northward, so too starting to move through apace (say starting from stationary to moving) takes away from your movement through time. Just need to calculate 4-dimensional geometry, weird, but not very difficult maths.<br/><br/>Thus clocks moving at different speeds keep different times, and atomic clocks taken on a jet measured vs clocks on the ground have proved this even on earth. And so you can never approach the speed of light. Therefore it is always constant.<br/><br/>Also shows how simultaneity doesn't necessarily exist. It's relative between people. But ultimately space, and time are relative, but spacetime is absolute, just like Newton thought space was.<br/><br/>That's special relativity - constant motion. What about acceleration? Also what about gravity? This was the big flaw for Einstein, since it seems to move faster than light. How does it work? He thought about it a lot and this led to general relativity. In fact even Newton said he didn't get how it worked.<br/><br/>Einstein explained gravity as distortions in spacetime. So the presence of a massive body propagates a wave through spacetime that attracts other bodies. This moves at the speed of light, not instantly! And connected this with the puzzle of acceleration. Einstein said that acceleration is relative to spacetime, and that only someone weightless can be said to be not accelerating. If you're feeling that pull, you're accelerating relative to spacetime. In other words, the pull of gravity is equivalent to the pull of acceleration. The only person who doesn't feel it is someone in freefall. Einstein is broadly Machian, in that acceleration is relative to something, but for him it's not relative to other matter - it's to spacetime itself. Einstein originally cited Mach as a key influence but eventually rejected his idea.<br/><br/>Quantum Mechanics<br/>Light tends to act like a wave. But unlike water, which has waves made out of particles, the actual particles themselves individually behave in a wavelike way. What kind of wave could this be? The answer turned out to be crazy: a probability wave! The electron's location, or photon or any other particle, is a function of probabilities. Very high around some areas, but non-zero even on the other end of the universe. Thus world changes from deterministic to probabilistic.<br/><br/>Einstein with Podolski and Rosen wrote a paper trying to prove that particles do really have positions, before people observe them, thus quantum mechanics doesn't explain the true state of things. But there's an idea with looking at which direction the particle is spinning along one of three axes, with 2 different detectors - if deterministic, should agree more than half of the time? Not exactly sure. Results prove EPR to be wrong.<br/><br/>Part 2 - Time<br/>Talks about if time is something we can move about in, like a river frozen. People very far away would see in their ""now"" events that happened in the ancient past, but wouldn't be able to affect them.<br/><br/>Can time's arrow move backwards? Entropy tends to increase. Egg breaking but not unbreaking. This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Although all physical laws seem symmetrical around time direction, entropy goes only one way. But this is only probability. Where does any order (low entropy) come from? Answer: the Big Bang caused a uniform distribution of gases like hydrogen, deuterium, etc, ordinarily a high entropy sitch, but under the influence of gravity a low-entropy one! Since gravity pulls it into clusters. Thus we know time's arrow goes forward because most likely we went from one-off low entropy event (Big Bang under gravity) to high, than the other way around. Even when order exists it comes at the expense of more order - entropy is always in the black.<br/><br/>Quantum Mechanics + time.<br/>If electron goes from A to B, it has probability waves going over every possible path between them. This is what Feynman calls the sum of histories approach. True of a baseball too - takes every possible path, but with bigger objects the possibilities are so small that classical physics works.<br/><br/>If we observe a particle it becomes a particle, if not it's a wave. How does human observation change this? This is a huge, crazy question, and we're not sure of the answer to it, no clear consensus. Wheeler has an experiment where you have detectors along the way, and so the photon ""decides"" in the past to be a particle not a wave, when there is future human observation!! Discusses different theories, including multiverse, and how they could answer the arrow of time issue.<br/><br/>Cosmology<br/>Hubble noticed in California in 1929 that galaxies were all rushing away. Why? Was earth the centre of ancient explosion? Answer was no, and based on relativity. Universe was expanding, so all galaxies would appear to be riding away from each other at equal speed, like pennies drawn on an expanding balloon. And because space expansion is uniform speed, they are all basically stationary relative to space, which is why clocks agree - hence we have one age for the universe, not many. But we're not being pulled apart because of stronger nuclear forces holding us together.<br/><br/>Symmetry one of the most important concepts in cosmology, modern physics in general. Discusses possible shapes of the universe - sphere, infinite cube, torus (like video game screen - exit on one side and reappear on the other).<br/><br/>Inflationary universe - dark matter - gravitational waves - Higgs ocean, where we're all surrounded by Higgs particles dragging against us. this was discovered in an experiment at the LHC after book was published. String theory - many dimensions - gets progressively weirder. Last section is speculation about the future, time travel and teleportation, etc. I tend to be a grouchy skeptic about these things. The time travel paradox is very old hat, and doesn't add much to the plot of <i>Back to the Future</i>.<br/><br/>Did you seriously read all this? This is overall a pretty great book. It really does not contain any maths (although I often feel like having some would be better, because at some stage so much becomes ""for mathematical reasons beyond our scope, the 12-dimensional frogs must be in the shape of a donut""). Greene genuinely loves explaining science and gives you a sense of what's gone on in the field in the last 100-odd years. Even if you don't retain all that much of it, this book will reward your time invested handsomely. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.11000000000000032,2019,2,1607.0

The opposite is true: for much of the state's existence, the French army has been the dominant military force in Europe; but so much in war depends on external circumstances. The Franco-Algerian war is a good example. The French brought overwhelming force to bear on their FLN opponents and brought them to the brink of starvation and dispersal but, as in French Indochina not long before, they were to learn that people who have no option but to fight will always outlast those who don't.<br/><br/>The first two parts of this book briefly outline how France ended up absorbing Algeria, and describe the early formation of Algerian national feeling and the FLN. The government of Mendès France (last president of the IVe République) tried belatedly to give some rights to Muslim Algerians, but the <i>pied-noir</i> backlash brought it to its knees. Enter de Gaulle, the titanic figure who dominates the longest and best part of this book.<br/><br/>«Je vous ai compris» he told the crowds, <i>I have understood you</i>. But how? At first the <i>pied-noir</i>  took this to mean that the old general was on their side, perhaps the only thing that prevented a coup at the dawn of the Fifth Republic. But over time it took on a different meaning - perhaps more like, I understand how to deal with you. It's unclear what the laconic de Gaulle actually thought, but his position changed over time from refusing to see the FLN as an <i>interlocuteur valable</i>, to conceding to negotiating with them, then to a unilateral ceasefire, and eventually giving up on the Sahara oilfields and a speedier evacuation than planned, as well as the tragic exodus of the <i>pied-noir</i>. <br/><br/>The FLN were often brutal and thuggish, but they were tough and understood the postcolonial world order. It's a little hard to imagine in 2019  a time in which the West saw itself as a paragon of virtue, fresh from resisting Nazism.

How I hate the French!"") But before Vietnam, the US did, and a young JFK was a strong supporter of Algerian independence. Part of the story of Algeria is one of gradual recognition of how things were. De Gaulle was a brilliant politician, mercurial and inspirational, but he was unable to resist the forces of history, just to guide his nation through them. And despite Algeria's rocky journey after independence (repression of the Kabyle, fundamentalism, instability), no-one would argue that another outcome was possible in the long term. ""I believe in justice,"" said Camus, ""but I will defend my mother before justice.""

(Said understandably focuses mainly on the Near East, but he claims that his ideas apply equally to all ""Eastern"" peoples, from Turkey to India and China.) The most interesting part, a relatively small bit at the end, is where he extends this critique to modern scholars of ""Area Studies"", reserving particular scorn for the Arabists of the US State Department or oil companies, and conservative academics such as Bernard Lewis, whom he sees as direct continuers of Orientalist pseudoscholarship  in the service of extractive imperialism.<br/><br/>It is striking how the reputation of this book has mainly come from its use in departments of Art Historical, Literary and Cultural Studies, fields barely touched on this book. Together with his Columbia colleague Gayatri Spivak, Said's work spawned the entire field of Postcolonial Studies, one in which postmodernist thought and literary analysis play much stronger roles than the philology or archaeology of the erstwhile Orientalists. In other words, Said's book made a deep impact on our culture, but not in the way that he seems to have intended it to. Perhaps this is fitting: like Foucault (another writer I first read this year), Said is full of brilliant ideas but rarely marshals them into orderly lines of argument. He seems most at home when discussing French literature, but often pulls together theories based more on ideology than on facts. I was persuaded by some of his critiques of lazy stereotyping in modern writing (an egregious example being Samuel Huntington's portrayal of ""Islamic values"" in [b:The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order|413179|The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order|Samuel P. Huntington|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1338424958s/413179.jpg|403464]), but he discusses few facts, and when discussing his vision of a ""good"" Orientalism, seems to want something like Clifford Geertz's ""thick description"": anthropological studies comprising only of observations, and not attempting to draw any summary conclusions. That seems to me like a swing too far in the other direction. There are surely some conclusions to be drawn from prolonged, in-depth study of a region, not tainted by essentialism or cultural supremacy, but they may not always be palatable to their receivers.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,2.08,2018,12,397.0

So large parts of Prof Postman's get-off-my-lawn snark about TV is obsolete, but his rules are still helpful. A student of Marshall McLuhan, Postman's central tenet is the former's famous doctrine: the medium is the message. A TV can be used to prop up books, or for ambient reading light, but this doesn't make it a medium of literacy. Thus too all attempts to convert it into a medium of enlightenment will crash against the irresistible straitjacket of form. (Who still watches those dimly-lit, high-minded, long-monologue shows on public TV?) <br/><br/>Postman is most interesting when he tracks the shift in modes of thuoght between eras with different dominant media - from orality to writing, writing to printing, and printing to TV. In his telling, the US had the rare luck to be founded by intellectuals, and maintained astonishing levels of public interest in policy and rational debate until around the turn of the 20th century. Then several things changed: the rise of images and jingles in advertising, the invention of photography and telegraphy, and then the great menace of TV. The very concept of the day's news is a technological invention (he quotes the Luddish Thoreau: “We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate... We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.” ) <br/><br/>So what ought we to make of podcasts, blogs, even - dare we ask - Twitter? I think blogger Hossein Derakhshan (or <a href=""http://hoder.com/en/"">Hoder</a>) is right that<a href=""https://play.acast.com/s/theeconomistbabbage/babbage-alittlemoreconservation"">the internet started off primarily text-based</a>, and as it changes to be more image- and video-based, it has gotten worse, form dictating content. Twitter, and social media more generally, encourage snark, snap judgments, and anger. But there is so much else. Might, say, podcasts be our salvation?<br/><br/>I recently read a <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews"">blog post</a> arguing that reading the news has no value whatsoever to one's life. Setting aside the author and his tragic early death, I think this claim is embedded in a worldview that already seems quaint. Swartz thinks that if the newspaper criticises the mayor, the mayor will apologise or justify herself or whatever, so why does the reader need to get involved? But nowadays the mayor has her own media. It is harder to split entertainment on an axis of brain-food to brain-mush, and there are broader political quandaries.

Its underlying assumption is that the sole priority of gaining better focus is to become a higher-earning ""winner"", and it’s full of irrelevant and fatuous predictions about the future of the economy, leveraging the implicit threat that AI and genius programmers will make us all redundant unless we learn how to focus.<br/><br/>Later on the book improves slightly, wielding Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman and Hubert Dreyfus in an attempt to prove that greater focus leads to a more meaningful life. But at the end of the book's second half - a hodgepodge of simplistic anecdotes and cherry-picked research - Newport admits that this technique is worthwhile only to the extent that it increases your productivity. And yet: I can't unrecommend this entirely. If reading it inspires you to reduce the time you spend being distracted by the flashing lights of the internet, or even to stop yourself from prioritising mindless tasks over work you're proud of, it might be worthwhile.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,3.2,2018,12,275.0

I'm here to say: this book is <i>crazy</i>! But it's a fascinating read, as sort of creative nonfiction. Jaynes, a pretty respected psychologist writing in a time that was perhaps more receptive to New Age-y big picture ideas, thinks that a) schizophrenia is the natural, pre-conscious state of humans, which b) explains idolatry, ancestor worship and basically all religion from ancient times, and that c) consciousness is a relatively recent phenomenon which developed when external stresses broke up the ""bicameral"" societies (people whose minds were split into a speaking part, a sort of auditory (or sometimes visual) hallucination), and a listening part. He evinces examples from Greek literature, the Bible, and ancient history, as well as neuropsychological studies, his own experiences with schizophrenic patients, and his consumption of hallucinogens.

His history is global, and economically informed. But he's not the most fun to read. His sentences are crisp and learned, but this book is lumpy, crooked. It presents fascinating anecdotes which abruptly end. I kept asking myself what the central thesis is, and though I have some ideas, I'm still not sure. In an odd twist, most of the book covers a few years around WWI in great detail, while the last bit rushes through about a decade in almost no time, skipping the rise of Stalin and the Great Depression. <br/><br/>But here is what I think is his point: between WWI and the 1930s, the world shifted from being a multilateral sphere  of competing imperial Great Powers, to one of tenuous international organisations with the dominant presence of American might (and Wall Street finance) overshadowing it. Much of the war was paid for by loans from JP Morgan and his friends, and afterwards the victors were in nearly as bad financial shape as the losers. Much of the German repayments from  the Versailles Treaty went straight from Britain and France to America, where at some points they were lent back to Germany. And the book ends with Ramsey McDonald's courageous decisions to go off the gold standard and finally, unthinkably, default on war debts, saying:<br/><br/><blockquote>Payments that would upset the financial order such as it is would be treason to the whole world. We have to take upon ourselves the thankless task of putting an end to the folly of continuing to pay</blockquote><br/><br/>Mr Tooze is sympathetic to the pacifists and liberal internationalists, the animating spirit behind the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand ban on war, and Woodrow Wilson's desire for American influence to obtain ""peace without victory"" in the Great War, a New World Order rather than an intervention in favour of one side. Such ideas in his view weren't utopian folly but a way of dealing with new conditions: imperial might was untenable when everyone but the US was drowning in debt (and later when even the US looked ropy). Prior to the war, the Prussian or Westminster models of government (or ""Liberal Imperialism"") were seen as superior to democracy, but the tumultuous forces of nationalism, liberalism among imperial subjects, and the crushing economic depression eviscerated that order and set the stage for the violence of the next war, and the arrangement of the present time.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,2.16,2018,12,406.0

What emerged is that lack of clarity is a mark of studying Dewey; a youthful immersion in German Idealism, lack of humour and singularly infelicitous writing style made him flummox even his most sympathetic readers. O.W. Holmes Jr. put it best: ""So methought God would have spoken had He been inarticulate but keenly desirous to tell you how it was.""<br/><br/>Which is not to say that no-one gets Dewey. Ryan gives a thorough outline of his origins, intellectual inputs, main writing and controversies. Dewey was a towering figure in American intellectual life in his day, engaging in many public political and philosophical debates. One of his key ideas was that philosophy cannot be segregated from the public space, that daily life and political engagement must be natural outflows of one's metaphysical ideas. In the late 1890s Dewey expressed this with his involvement with Jane Addams' Hull House and the Laboratory School he founded in Chicago, and later it was progressive education that came to be the main focus of his thought.<br/><br/>More spiritual than his pragmatist peers (James, Peirce, Holmes), Dewey enveloped his thought in a deep layer of near-religious teleology. His early Congregationalist faith, which he would later rebel strongly against, coupled with his later Hegelianism (also eventually dropped, but less markedly) gave him this orientation. Dewey would become a materialist, but never a ""vulgar"" one; for him, individual fulfillment is impossible outside of community engagement. For this reason Dewey was seen <i>the</i> philosopher of America, a liberal idealist for whom democracy was not ""the worst form of government, except for all the others"" but the highest means through which the individual can find happiness. Until the end of his life Dewey would give ""lay sermons"" and was active in political debate. <br/><br/>However, as Holmes' quote hinted, his noumenal rhetoric never quite manifested itself in concrete terms, making Dewey open to misreadings, and ensuring there are no real ""Deweyists"" today. Attacked in his time from left and right, (he voted against FDR because he thought the New Deal didn't go far enough; but never stopped attacking the Communist Party for its subservience to Moscow and indifference to human rights, strongly and presciently opposing the evils of Stalinism, and even being involved in a Mexico hearing for Trotsky), Dewey was mostly forgotten after his death, then revived. Attacked by Christopher Lasch as an elitist, by Richard Hofstadter as anti-intellectual, Dewey finally found a champion in Richard Rorty, who saw him a more hopeful harbinger of postmodernism.<br/><br/>So after this big book, what is Dewey about? Firstly we can say what he opposed: big business/plutocracy, the Communist Party, rote learning (and the worship of classics such as the U Chicago Great Books program of Hutchins and Adler). As for the positive, Dewey advanced a communitarian ideal where education would uplift all citizens of a democracy into an engaged, participatory life. He supported learning through doing (some of his educational ideas are taken for granted nowadays), but also vaguer things. He advocated imbuing vocational training with more importance by making it less menial - but how? Dewey saw production under capitalism, just for the sake of a paycheck, as inherently  alienating  and inconducive with a fulfilled life. But how would his alternative society look? He acknowledged that the average man doesn't want to come back from work, grab some supper, and then head out to a meeting on which electricity supplier the neighbourhood should use.<br/><br/>Liberalism can mean many different things - Dewey's is much more like (in Isaiah Berlin's phrase that Ryan doesn't use) ""freedom to"" than ""freedom from"", much unlike JS Mill, Smith, and Hayek. Dewey also differs from the contemporary American left, which is a more practical Social Democracy lite. Dewey cannot be said to have given undue focus to practical issues, and his work can be frustrating, its meaning never quite coming into focus. But that blurry vision is still audacious and inspiring.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.2799999999999998,2018,11,688.0

She is also an MIT- and Harvard-trained philosopher who currently lectures at Cornell.<br/><br/>This book is not fun to read, being an unremitting litany of grievous misogyny: from the violent (Elliot Rodger's deadly rampage at UC Santa Barbara) to the casual, including much about the 2016 elections and America's current president. Manne mostly (though not always) stays cool and detached, using the tools and argot of analytic philosophy. She uses the metaphor of a customer and a server at a restaurant to describe male-female relations, where men feel entitled to service and pleasantness from women, and feel aggrieved if they do not receive them.<br/><br/>While ostensibly a (popular) work of moral philosophy, this often feels exhortative, more like social critique. Rather than referring to things widely considered wrong, Manne often jumps into the heat of currently raging ideological battles,  calling out evil and taxonomising it along with stranglers and mass shooters. At least some of the things she classifies as misogynist - like the poetry of Shel Silverstein - might have a more charitable reading. The extent to which misogyny affected Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign (or Julia Gillard's tenure as Australian PM) seems open to discussion; certainly not nothing, but surely not 100% either. For Manne, the idea that Clinton was seen as an ""establishment"" candidate can be nothing other than bare misogyny. (Relevant disclosure: I'm not American, but I was only ever rooting for a Hillary win.)<br/><br/>In a famous essay called <a href=""http://aleph.nli.org.il/F?func=find-b&request=000481232&find_code=SYS&local_base=RMB01"">Away From a Definition of Antisemitism</a>, the historian David Engel criticises the idea of using a single term for, say, Christian or Islamic persecution of Jews and the Nazi kind, or overly personal criticisms of Israel. One could similarly question to what extent it is right to cite one explanatory mechanism for all these complex issues. <br/><br/>In general, the use of moral absolutes in discussing fraught political issues seems potentially reckless. In 2015, after the Conservative victory in elections in Britain, the philosopher Rebecca Roache wrote a post on Oxford University's Practical Ethics Blog declaring that ""<a href=""http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/05/if-youre-a-conservative-im-not-your-friend/"">If you’re a Conservative, I’m not your friend</a>"". Saying that the other half of the country is not just in disagreement but immoral is not obviously wrong - the classic Ethics 101 example of Germany under the Nazis comes to mind. But it seems like a claim requiring extraordinary evidence. Manne represents liberal beliefs with which I'm almost entirely in accord, but the righteous anger with which she brands her ideological opponents seems unsupported to me. The book ends not with prescriptions but with despair (although Manne is at work on a sequel entitled <i>Himpathy</i>, one of several neologisms in the book), something seemingly inevitable under a worldview in which unveiled hatred is everywhere and incurable.<br/><br/>Also of note is Moira Weigel's mild critique of this book from the Left, found <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/20/down-girl-kate-manne-review"">here</a>.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,female,2.29,2018,11,531.0

The story of the Papacy must to some extent be a history of Europe: after all, the Papal States were a major political player for most of it. Norwich recaps the respective heroism and ignominy of different popes, giving political and theological background and requoting some of Gibbon's most epic burns, e.g. <blockquote>we read, with some surprise, that the worthy grandson of Marozia lived in public adultery with the matrons of Rome; that the Lateran Palace was turned into a school for prostitution; and that his rapes of virgins and widows had deterred the female pilgrims from visiting the shrine of St. Peter, lest, in the devout act, they should be violated by his successor</blockquote> as well as the well-known <blockquote>the most scandalous charges were suppressed; the vicar of Christ was only accused of piracy, murder, rape, sodomy, and incest</blockquote>Norwich is an ""agnostic Protestant"" who is fond of the Papacy but doesn't cover anything up, dealing briefly with the worst popes of the ""pornocracy"", the Borgias, and Pius XII and the Nazis, as well as putting to bed the legend of a female Pope (since which time a junior cleric feels up each new Pope and ""shouts out in a loud voice, 'He has testicles!'

There is background chatter of India and Palestine, de Gaulle and Stalin, but none of it matters a whit, because the narrator is listless and unhappy, perhaps bipolar, nursing an unreciprocated crush on her cousin Casmilus.

It took me an eighteen month hiatus before I could get past the book's ""hump"" - just before the somewhat climactic events of Walpurgis Night, where the plot starts to gather speed a little. But plot is not what drives The Magic Mountain: rather, it is ideas, as Hans Castorp, a nondescript, though intellectually curious, engineer, engages with the novel's ideologues (Settembrini, Naptha), personalities (Chavcha, Behrens), boredom, and the forces of nature. If journalism is writing about uncommon events and novels are about universal ones, this book is perhaps about the space in between events - a painfully long yet desultory, and seemingly endless stay in a small snowy mountain as the forces of Enlightenment and imperialism roil down in the flatland. Mann weaves a Wagnerian <i>leitmotif</i> of time into the novel. None at all will pass for hundreds of pages, and then years will fly by in a sentence.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to get at is that this book is, by accident and by intention, alienating to the modern reader, and one might be forgiven for passing it up. But if you're willing to brave it. it  presents a unique and rare challenge. It is a world of solitude, slowness, and occasional world-historical debates laced with the Classical learning of yesteryear which (if you graduated high school after 1950) will have you Googling a lot. And when, finally, you come down from the mountain and see the world, fast-paced and hurtling toward disaster, you will not understand it any better.

Lee is in some ways the dumb version of PLF - both in knowledge (Fermor knows his history backwards and picks up languages quickly, while Lee cheerfully brags of his ignorance about Spain, and knows only a single line of Spanish), and also in common sense - he haphazardly tramps forward, almost dying multiple times of exposure, heat, or a pack of wild dogs. But both share a sense of adventure: they are young men seeking a full-throated experience of a land both unknown but close enough culturally to provide some small continuity.<br/><br/>Lee's story is astonishing, getting increasingly hair-raising as the Spanish Civil War approaches, and at times I was a little skeptical.

The world it mocks has mostly disappeared, and occasional footnotes fill in some of the blanks.

Rosen is an excellent (and studiously nonpartisan) legal writer and commentator with an interest in constitutional history. <br/><br/>Brandeis switched opinions often: from anti- to pro-Zionism, anti- to pro-women's suffrage, anti- to pro-unions. He was opposed to ""bigness"" - big business, big government, and even big unions; a Jeffersonian agrarian libertarian who thought that small, engaged communities were the best political model. <br/><br/>This made him a more liberal figure, opposed as he was to the big trusts of the Gilded Age. Nominated by Wilson, his confirmation was very controversial for the time (ha!), the first to have a public hearing and still the longest - not because of antisemitism, though it existed (his SCOTUS colleague James Clark McReynolds would leave the room when he started talking), but mainly because he was against JP Morgan and his ilk. Brandeis wrote a book called [b:Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It|1125344|Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It (The Bedford Series in History and Culture)|Louis D. Brandeis|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1315625387s/1125344.jpg|1112455] critiquing the financial system, which became a lot more popular after 1929. One of the interesting modern-day issues not directly mentioned in the book is the idea of Amazon as a monopoly. Lina Khan has led her <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/lina-khan-antitrust/561743/"">""hipster antitrust"" crusade</a> against the company, which relies on redefining the law to cover even a company which does not make prices more expensive for consumers, but has other insidious effects. It seems that Brandeis might have been sympathetic to this, just as he might have opposed other behemoth retail chains like Walmart - an opposition to their very bigness as something inconducive to civil engagement and community life.<br/><br/>Brandeis' (perhaps more famous) colleague OW Holmes Jr. was pragmatist almost to the point of nihilism - he propounded a legal realism that saw the law basically as what exists when judges decide. Brandeis himself was more of what we might call a Positivist. His famous 'Brandeis Brief' was 98% sociological/empirical facts, not abstract arguments about legal principles. Only by analysing the real life impact of the issues did he think that the legal solution could be found. (Brandeis was also an elitist who thought that consumers were dumb and the agrarian life the ideal, and that Periclean Athens was the height of civilisation.)<br/><br/>On modern-day issues, Rosen thinks that Clinton-era neoliberalism (such as the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which Brandeis helped put in place) is 'unBrandeisian', as it allows the growth of huge financial monsters - and in fact during the financial crisis the 'too big to fail' banks got bailed out, not the smaller ones who had avoided dodgy proprietary trading. The Dodd-Frank Act, according to Rosen, was an attempt to bring some of this back, although a more Brandeisian solution would have been to tax financial services companies above a certain size, basically keeping them small. (Apparently this was floated in 2008 but died in Congress.)<br/><br/>Other major Brandeis ideas include the right to privacy (a term he invented!), but also the idea that ""sunlight is the best disinfectant"" in terms of the public's right to know. His far-seeing dissent in 'Olmstead vs US' said that the government wiretapping a citizen's phone was an illegal violation of privacy (he also thought that TV was two-way communication, an idea more premature than wrong!)<br/><br/>In an epilogue, Rosen tosses up a few other interesting issues: he thinks Brandeis would not have included the EU's ""right to be forgotten"" in the right to privacy (as it goes against freedom of speech), but maybe would have opposed vertical media mergers (such as that of AT&T and Time Warner earlier this year) and the cancellation of ""net neutrality"". He believed that it was worth sacrificing efficiency for the sake of democratic engagement. But on the other hand, perhaps he would have felt that the internet provides other outlets for engagement, an omnipresent village square reducing the need for the corner shop. A stretch?

I actually, as someone without much prior interest in the field, didn't learn so much new information? But it's nice to have it all in one place. Gaddis is definitely on the more Orthodox side, having looped back after the Revisionists to present a fairly triumphalist Western view of the war. He sees its origins in Stalin's paranoia, and partly in the fear of appeasement that was a hangover from Neville Chamberlain, and its resolution as a result of the inevitable desire of people for free speech and free markets. In his view hawkish US presidents such as Nixon and Reagan were overwhelmingly successful in their approach to the Russians.

He sees its origins in Stalin's paranoia, and partly in the fear of appeasement that was a hangover from Neville Chamberlain, and its resolution as a result of the inevitable desire of people for free speech and free markets. In his view hawkish US presidents such as Nixon and Reagan were overwhelmingly successful in their approach to the Russians.

Anderson frère is wonderfully erudite and readable, but it struck me that the argument was totally futile: the two authors are utterly incommensurate, and any attempt to quantify the merit of one over the other is laughable (to say nothing of the bean-counting of sentence length, number of unique characters, proper nouns, etc. that Anderson at times stoops to marshaling).<br/><br/>Reading this book at times made me feel the same. Anderson is amazingly learned, particularly in South-East Asian history, and makes his conclusions feel inescapable, obvious even. Yet as I would turn them over in my mind, the certainty would evaporate, and I wondered if the facts could have been just as easily construed otherwise. (This reminded me a lot of my recent experience reading Foucault's [b: The History of Sexuality|1875|The History of Sexuality, Volume 1  An Introduction|Michel Foucault|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1486236798s/1875.jpg|5991].)<br/><br/>The Wikipedia page I skimmed informs me that there are several major schools of thought on the history of nationalism. There is the naive view, that nations are ancient, coherent groups, that waited until modernity  to find expression after the fall of the repressive empires. (For more on this, see the fire-breathing Yoram Hazony's recent [b: The Virtue of Nationalism|37977136|The Virtue of Nationalism|Yoram Hazony|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1531164007s/37977136.jpg|59699961], doing the rounds now.) For Gellner, nationalism is concomitant with European industrialisation; for Kedourie, it was brought to the colonies by Westerners. Anderson's theory is that in fact nationalism began with creoles in the colonies, seeking to define a status for themselves distinct from the colonial class they were barred from, and at the cost of granting solidarity to the natives (who were about to revolt). This then spread to the colonisers, to the point where today there are no empires, and everyone gets an equal seat as a nation.<br/><br/>An important concept for Anderson is 'print capitalism'. This, together with historical linguistics - the first science explicitly founded on the idea of evolution - is part of the replacement of the ancient, 'holy' languages. A bourgeoisie almost by definition has to be connected by print, unlike an aristocracy. The printing press gave expression to suppressed identities, at the same time forcing a Darwinian selection  - it wouldn't have had such liberatory potential if each dialect had its own script, and so there was a centralisation, converging on a few winning dialects around which national identity coalesced (e.g. Low/Flat German was oral only, not printed; thus less important). Governments always want to suppress printed dialects, but don't care about spoken ones; Russia and Turkey forced their population to Cyrilicise/Latinise respectively. If the old empires pushed a single language, it was out of convenience, not chauvinism.<br/><br/>As he explains in an afterword, Anderson delights in taking down Western orthodoxies, and in comparing countries to those much poorer than them or geographically remote. His book was seen as too liberal for Marxists and too Marxist for liberals, a satisfying medium of idiosyncrasy, and has experienced a long afterlife, perhaps especially relevant in our times.<br/><br/>Why is William the Conqueror, who spoke no English (a language which did not yet exist), seen as an English cornerstone, rather than as a ravager, a Napoleon or a Hitler? The obvious answer is that tragedy plus time equals nationalism. But this doesn't give us an idea of how to ameliorate the effects of what might be called in modern parlance toxic nationalism. ""Who will willingly die for the EEC? Where is the Tomb of the Unknown Liberal?"" Anderson jests. The idea of why a nation-community is seen as something one would give one's life for, rather than a convenience, is of pretty critical importance to the European Union.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.09999999999999964,2018,10,645.0

This wasn't (as you might expect) due to corrupt politicians and lobbyists, but a carefully monitored experiment. The government tentatively allowed the company to run as a monopoly in exchange for it constantly needing to prove its worth through research (and defense work, when needed) and to provide infrastructure and service across the country at fixed prices. (And even so, the Justice Department never really gave up on trying to shut it down.) Controlled prices in exchange for no competition: a surprisingly socialist idea for the Cold War era! Nowadays, with a nominally free telecoms market, there are a <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/why-americas-internet-is-so-shitty-and-slow-1686173744"">host of problems</a>, particularly last-mile access in rural areas. So it isn't so clear that the breakup of Ma Bell into Baby Bells was the best decision.<br/><br/>Anyway, this book is not about this at all. It's about how, while that arrangement held, Bell Labs was the one-company Silicon Valley plus of its age, pulling in the best minds and letting them cross-pollinate and range freely. As a result, the world got the transistor (and thus modern computing), information theory, satellite communication (GPS, satellite TV dish), cellular networks for mobile phones, laser, fibre optics, UNIX, C...<br/><br/>Jon Gertner is a model science writer. He has the passion of an enthusiast but the moderation of a seasoned writer; never acting like the material is too arcane for our little minds, while still making it clear that these people were serious boffins. He adds some biographical flavor, but doesn't let it take over the story.<br/><br/>The big question this book poses is how the conditions for world-changing innovation can be created. Bell Labs was superseded by Silicon Valley, a hypercapitalist environment where small companies rise and fall constantly. In fact, some of the early Silicon Valley firms were started by Bell Labs alumni or their students, including IBM, Intel and Hewlett Packard, while others were means to commercialise Bell Labs ideas (Motorola made cellphones, Texas Instruments invented the integrated circuit). Government agencies such as DARPA and university research are other models that have often been crucial to technological progress.<br/><br/>Bell Labs is perhaps unmatched today, even by the likes of Google, but it made lots of mistakes too (such as a picturephone which consumers never liked). It's unclear if it was just right at its time or if its model was something we should recreate. Many of its luminaries thought that it benefited from a longer horizon - unlike at say, IBM, researchers had a longer horizon (around 30 years) for their innovations being profitable, the perks of a regulated monopoly. The critique is often made that Silicon Valley companies focus only on immediately profitable ideas (although Facebook and Google's enormous wealth has allowed them too to take some speculative bets). Whether another Bell Labs could still be doing groundbreaking science in 2018 is not just a thought experiment, but something policy-makers should think hard about.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.8399999999999999,2018,8,495.0

Hearing talk about ""water-stuff"" or ""sour-stuff"" rather than Hydrogen or Oxygen sounds rather amateurish; we have convinced ourselves that the recondite Classicism of ""deoxyribonucleic acid"" represents something essential and unmoving, nature <i>as it is</i>. <br/><br/>Of course, this is a fiction. Science grubs together assumptions and guesses, moving in fits and starts, not always in the right direction, and its practitioners are just as vain and susceptible to groupthink as the rest of the human race. Recent news of the ""replicability crisis"" has further weakened the consensus around the existing system of experiment, peer review and publication.<br/><br/>And yet. Most systematic critiques of science, the ones proposing a whole new system, are far more terrifying than the system they seek to replace. I'm a pretty open-minded person, but some of the ideas summarised in this book - whole-cloth rejections of science as an  imperialist relic of the Enlightenment, thrown around by the kind of people mocked by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair"">l'Affaire Sokal</a>, are pretty awful.<br/><br/>The philosophy of science goes back around 100 years. The main schools are the Logical Positivists, pretty much dead now (they believed that nothing that couldn't be demonstrated had any meaning), Popper's verificationism (probably the best known theory, popular with scientists), Kuhn's idea of paradigm shifts, and a spattering of feminist, sociological, economist, and social constructivists critiques that score some valid points but often seem untethered from reality.<br/><br/>Today, the dominant ideas are naturalism, the idea that natural forces are all there is, motivated by what Hilary Putnam called the ""miracle"" of science; empiricism, a sort of skeptical-Kantian claim that all we can know is the phenomenal world, and there's no point speculating on anything metaphysical; and scientific realism, similar to naturalism but claiming that moral or mathematical facts also exist as part of a scientific reality. Godfrey-Smith is a competent but not overly ambitious or exciting narrator (though his squirming in a section on Bayesian Inference is amusing), and this seems like a good summary of the general ideas. This didn't make me want to read more Phil of Sci: one gets the impression that beyond some basic paradoxes (the nature of reality, Goodman's new riddle of induction, metaphysical realism) a lot of the century seems to have been spent going in circles. Science: it's a bit silly, really, but as long as those rockets launch and bridges stand up, it's the best we've got.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,3.9,2018,8,436.0

Take Neville Chamberlain: in seeking to prevent a war in Europe at all costs, he was totally representative of the British people, who had lived through the Great War and wanted to avoid a repeat of it no matter what. (Although he did perhaps go further, refusing to even condemn Hitler's outrages.) Chamberlain was fêted, until he wasn't; contradicted by events and embarrassed by public outrage, he eventually stepped down a broken man and was replaced by Churchill, the war-mongering outcast vindicated at last. But of course, sometimes the Churchills of the world <i>are</i> wrong...<br/><br/>Or take Hitler: in many ways, he was a very consistent person, basically outlining his life philosophy in Mein Kampf and following it all the way (referring here to what he <i>did</i>; if you look at what he was <i>saying</i>, his constant straight-up lies would have made even Machiavelli blush). So the Allies missed a  lot of chances by not wanting to escalate things: letting Hitler move first and seize the advantage. But in other circumstances, the prudent, non-escalating move would have been right. So how can we tell?<br/><br/>I don't have an answer, this is just a (pretty trivial) thought I had while reading this book. Shirer was a journalist who lived through and reported on the events at hand, giving this account a freshness and immediacy not found in most academic histories. (Some academics have sniped at the book, as Shirer details in a slightly petty afterword [writers: never read your reviews!]. But it seems that their biggest criticism revolves around the theory that Germans were inherently more susceptible to Nazism, the so-called ""Buber-to-Hitler"" theory, which seems pretty subjective.) But this book has still become the most popular  history of the Third Reich.<br/><br/>Covering so many events, Shirer hurtles through them, skimming over much of WWII and focusing mostly on events within the Reich, such as the bungled plots to kill Hitler. I'll just list some points I found new or interesting:<br/><br/>1. Hitler had diverse strengths, and just one famous shortcoming, namely that he was mad as a March hare. Had he tried only to get Germany to the best position possible, he could have been thought of as one of history's great statesmen - the way he split his allies, making a pact with Russia to avoid a repeat of the Entente Cordiale, pushing the international community's desire to avoid war as far as was possible to swallow up his neighbours bloodlessly. But he was also focused on a) relentlessly growing in the East, even at the cost of starting a huge war and b) committing genocide, enslavement, and all the other bizarre horrors.<br/><br/>2. In some ways the saddest of the Nazi atrocities are those perpetrated during the last years of the war (both on POWs and in the death camps), when it was clear Germany was going to lose. Hitler's fanatical intransigence, determination to fight to the end, and occasional strategic genius kept it going far longer than it might've, against the will of his generals. (His insistence that the troops hold their lines during the first winter in Russia, for example, was justified: had they retreated, most of the generals later conceded that the army would probably have been routed, not really having anywhere to fall back to. But his refusal to allow the 6th army to pull out of Stalingrad directly lead to the death of nearly 200,000 Germans.)<br/><br/>3. Beneš, the Czech leader, fainted as he was browbeaten into signing away his country, and had to be given injections several times by one of the many sinister Nazi doctors that populate this history.<br/><br/>4. Hitler really liked Mussolini for reasons no-one understood (he was a half-hearted ally, and the Italian army was almost comically bad), but they had a fraught relationship. Mussolini hated how Hitler would wake him in the middle of the night for phone calls, and he would only tell him that he was planning to invade a country after his troops had already begun the attack. Mussolini invaded Greece basically just so that he could inform Hitler after the fact, which drove Hitler nuts. In the end, though, the Italians got stuck and the Germans had to come and finish the job.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.16999999999999993,2018,7,722.0

Around this story is a record written by a blind old man named Zampanò, around which is another story by a troubled man named Johnny Truant, involving some buried childhood trauma, classic <i>Slacker</i>-era '90s nihilism, drugs, and lots of meaningless sex with generically gorgeous women. Around this is an astonishingly convincing array of imagined academic literature - referenced in painstaking detail - referring to a world in which the central story is the subject of countless magazine stories, TV interviews, academic books and monographs, etc. <br/><br/>And that's not even what makes this book so unusual: that, revealed to the reader on a casual flip, is the way it is formatted. The words jump across the page, slanting, shrinking, building shapes, disappearing, switching languages or disappearing, changing colours.

Every page in this book is full of bizarre details; every page makes you ask questions. But...maybe not in an interesting way? Are there any real answers to them? Is there a complex hidden message to all of this, or is it just a postmodern commentary on textuality, a collage open to arbitrary interpretation?<br/>Which is fine.

In the age of reader-response theory/<i>la mort de l'auteur</i>, we no longer need one text: instead, we have one reader's notes on another's notes on another's ... near the end one of the narrators meets a musician who has read his book and added his own notes. At times, <i>House of Leaves</i> evokes a bygone tradition of index cards and hand-written notes, lovingly photographed at the back (another of the many 'get out!' moments)  But this book is of the hypertext era, originally circulated online, accruing further layers of commentary-cum-narrative.

Each of these four novellas comes with a URL, and the title and content allude to contemporary WWW-related issues (the instantaneity of email, the ubiquity of porn, online shaming).

Each of these four novellas comes with a URL, and the title and content allude to contemporary WWW-related issues (the instantaneity of email, the ubiquity of porn, online shaming). In our high-speed culture, though, technology seems to be adapting, Proteus-like, more quickly than writers can get their heads around it, leaving their fiction and satire as embarrassingly <i>passé</i> as the '90s cyberpunk stuff one still finds at garage sales and used bookstores. <br/><br/>But obsolescence isn't the major problem here, at least for now. After the first (and most engaging) story - about a campus drug dealer exposed online for a sexual contretemps at a frat party - the prose veers into increasingly unclear and uneven territory.

For the most part, his Victorians grandparents are pure nobility: her good-natured, kind, and long-suffering; him talented, hardworking, and honest to a fault, but also tender and loving. Over and over, after grandfather drops a decision on grandmother and she reacts in outrage, she ends up tearfully apologising. (He does have a drinking problem, though.) Apparently these letters were based on the real-life letters of Mary Hallock Foote, though to what extent the picture has been sanitised by her or Stegner we can only guess.<br/><br/>By contrast the younger generation are repped by the heartless son who wants to send his father off to Menlo Park (metonym for a retirement home, not the social media behemoth of today), and a dropout secretary with a deadbeat ex-boyfriend.<br/> <br/>There are some tales of the West in the days of Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane, though the emphasis is more on the story of a marriage and its aftermath, and its echos in the narrator's own failed marriage and isolation. Several times he calls upon engineering terms (the Doppler effect, or the titular angle of repose) to illustrate his view of personal and national history. The effect of these metaphors is limited, but overall this story, despite its somewhat shaggy-dog ending, is an effective study of the harsh struggles of the American west, and the frustrations of the older generation with the romanticism of the young.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.2699999999999996,2015,5,297.0

Unlike the Yehoashes, Peretzes, and Shalom Aleichems of his time, Nadir (the <i>nom de plume</i> of Yitzchak Rayz) was a satirist, gadfly and bon vivant. A good chunk of his professional life was spent defending the Communist Party, a position he eventually retreated from after the Molotov-von Ribbentrop pact. And the bulk of this book is cornball humour about first-gen Jewish immigrants dealing with American life, chasing money and women, and yearning for home. Only in occasional retrospective moods do we see something more valuable: actual reflection on this generational seachange, the break between religious fathers and materialist sons, the ruptures of migration, and the transience and fragility of the creative life. In a few lilting closing paragraphs, Nadir finally grapples with some of these questions. You needn't waste your time on the rest.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.7999999999999998,2018,5,231.0

Well. He <i>is</i> singular, erudite and original: but also single-minded in all his writing (this is a 600 pp book, but contains all of his fiction, mostly written in a burst in his final decade). Alternately jubilant and cynical tales of love, often between young women and older men. Not that the women are less fleshed out or passive. But it does get a bit dull.<br/><br/>The term ""middle-class morality"" implies an aristocracy unconcerned with moral signalling, with nothing to prove. Spackman's character's embody this. They sometimes work vaguely as writers (though one is a banker, to be fair), travel frequently, and enjoy lives of privileges and adulterous affairs. Drawing on themes from Ovid, Restoration comic dramatists like Wyatt, and a handful of French writers (these origins are traced by Steven Moore in an afterword, but frequently invoked in the books themselves), Spackman describes writes defenses of carefree cuckoldry and lovers sunning themselves before the grave beckons. Seeing these books as representative of such an old tradition may excuse how astonishingly retrograde their social politics seem to us.<br/><br/>Spackman would wish to be judged on style, and he certainly delivers. Almost every page will send you to a dictionary, and unless you are fluent in Classics and Romances (WMS was a Rhodes scholar and sometime Classics professor), you will need several types. The prose here is not comparable to anything written today. I'm just not sure I needed so much of it in one go. <br/><br/>A final note: I saw Spackman's <i>Collected Essays</i> on a recent pilgrimage to <a href=""http://www.threelives.com/"">Three Lives and Company </a>, apparently it too has been recently published by Dalkey Archive.

Over time, in the way of the <i>nouveau riche</i>, some of them turned to collecting and patronising art. Edmund de Waal, a scion of the family through his father's mother, tells the story of this family history through a collection of netsuke (Japanese miniature carvings) and a century of stormy personal and political history.<br/><br/>de Waal himself is a pretty successful artist (though he does have an English degree), and writes like one. His eye lingers on facades of buildings, carved staircases, the way a room is decorated. And so this book has two very different parts. The first, which can be slow going, tells the story of Charles Ephrussi, one of the brothers who was freed of the family business and allowed to indulge his cultural passions. He became a noted art historian, writing monographs on Dürer and supporting many of the Impressionists, and was the model for Swann in <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18796.In_Search_of_Lost_Time"">In Search of Lost Time</a>. He first bought the netsuke at the beginning of the 19th century mania for <i>Japonisme</i>. <br/><br/>But then World War I breaks out, and the narrator, with his elegiac, Sebaldian tone, turns to history, and the predictably unpleasant fate of Jews (and particularly wealthy and prominent ones) under the Nazi jackboot. Thanks partly to their wealth, education and connections, the fate of the characters in the book was much better than that of most of their compatriots: this is a story of exile and loss of a fortune, but not of the death camps. Eventually the netsuke end up with a great-uncle in Japan, completing their circle.<br/><br/>This book is slow and lovingly told, often looking with empathic imagination through the eyes of children or their parents. It's a story of wealth, sophistication and visual culture, of a family buffeted by uncontrollable forces, and of the pull of beautiful objects.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.1299999999999999,2018,3,329.0

(The life of Thorstein Veblen in particular is a delight.) Here are some unsystematic notes I took, mostly about Marx:<br/><br/>1) Capitalism is based on constant instability, a series of crises (what another might call creative destruction...) in which the system only works provided you have a) constant growth and b) constant technological innovation. <br/><br/>2) This seems to be accepted today: we can date Capitalism from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, up until our current time of continued industrial and technological growth. But (putting on a Malthusian cap) it doesn't seem like something which can, in theoretical terms, extend forever. The world's resources are finite, technological innovation is ? , and the robots might soon be able to do it all faster and better than us. In a post-growth, post-work, post-scarcity society, what is the optimal allocation of resources? <br/><br/>3) This all sounds very futurist, but my basic point is this: Capitalism is by definition limited to a given historical situation, and finite in duration.<br/><br/>4) Capitalism leads to increasing inequality. This also seems true, and as world growth drags, is increasingly felt in the political sphere. But here, enough concessions to social democracy may be enough to ameliorate these damages.<br/><br/>5) Obviously, Marx was wrong about a lot - both in theory, in predictions, and in actual mathematical errors. Writing an enormous, scientific system around some intuitions doesn't make them any more right. But his innovations were to think about labour as a commodity, about the importance of means of production, and about the ways in which social, cultural and political forces are connected.<br/><br/>~~~~<br/><br/>Continuation, after hearing this <a href=""http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/podcasts/elucidations.html#103"">'Elucidations' podcast episode with Brian Leiter</a><br/><br/>Leiter is fair when discussing the ways in which Marx was wrong and right, and in how the Marxist analysis applies to the contemporary US. But there are two things in which he is tremendously unfair.<br/><br/>1 is a general critique I have of rich-world leftists: anachronism, and local-centrism. It's all too easy to paint a picture of the misery and continuing immiseration of the world. But what are you comparing it to? In almost all times in the past, in almost all classes, life was worse than it is today. (This is maybe the most popular argument for capitalism, but it's true.) Perhaps you can point to a decline in living standards for a certain class over a short time span - say, the middle class has less real income today than 30 years ago - but it's always narrowly focused, and usually the result of an unusual boom or unsustainable welfare policy. To take that example, in the interim, the Chinese middle class has become enormously better off, so there have been huge gains, just redistributed. As a non-American, I'm not inclined to complain about a system that moves wealth from the American middle class to the Chinese poor. (Ah, they argue, but the wealthy have become wealthier! But we cannot focus on the distribution without looking at overall welfare. Capitalism is bumpy, and has vectors of increasing inequality/misery as well as the opposite. But the sum of those vectors is positive, in theory, and it seems to hold so far.) [Sidebar: another important lesson of the book is that all of the attempts to find systematic economic laws in the last few centuries have failed, because society, economies, technology have changed in such unpredictable ways that every scenario seems to require a new toolkit, without much ability to generalise.]<br/><br/>2 is Leiter's attack on moral philosophers. He claims that the ruling class is avaricious and ruthless, and one of the interviewers asks him if there's a moral element involved. Leiter adopts the Marxist argument that all moral intuitions flow from class structures: that our contemporary moral ideas all ""happen to"" coincide with the interests of the ruling class. I think this massively begs the question of moral philosophy, namely what is the good. He *assumes* that equal distribution of wealth should be our end goal, that everyone is equally deserving of the same amount, and thus that anything that doesn't contribute to this goal is immoral. This is basically to deny the validity of the moral intuitions of almost everyone who lived before Marx, and of most people today: to take everything and make it about one issue, which is very open to debate. It's craziness.<br/><br/>One last point: I mentioned above the Malthusian point about the finitude of resources. Marx takes it up, but offers no solution to it. The real heirs of Malthus are the environmentalists, although even they are split on this issue, as Walter Berglund laments in [b: Freedom|7905092|Freedom|Jonathan Franzen|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316729686s/7905092.jpg|9585796].

Either method would have been easier; there would be no lack of ammunition. Vance relates how getting Musk's consent for the book was tricky, and involved a number of negotiation rounds during which Musk at first insisted on final review privileges, and the right to add footnotes, before eventually yielding to the author's persistence. <br/><br/>To say that Elon Musk is a polarising figure is somewhat understating things. A child prodigy blessed with seemingly endless energy and ambition, he left his (and my) native South Africa for Canada and then the US, did stints at Penn and Stanford universities, before founding Zip2, a sort of proto-Google Maps, selling out, and then founding X.com, which would become (after a bloody corporate takeover) PayPal.<br/><br/>This left Musk as a young dotcom billionaire, and he decided to use the money on fulfilling his biggest dreams. He saw Silicon Valley's agility and geeky smarts as wasted on click-chasing ad companies, and yearned for the optimistic Space Age days of large-scale manufacturing ambition. He wanted to replicate our generation's software breakthroughs in the world of nuts and bolts. This eventually led him - through near bankruptcy and much-maligned failures - to take charge of three visionary startups: SpaceX, the private space company; electric car manufacturer Tesla; and solar energy provider Solar City. <br/><br/>So much for the good. The prosecution also has its say, and there is no shortage of witnesses to call up. Musk is a harsh employer, demanding major sacrifices from employees, haranguing them over minor errors, and firing on a whim even confidantes who have given him years of loyalty. He is consumed by his work to the exclusion of all else, and one gains the sense that the twice-divorced father of five is not much fun to be around. (He is currently remarried to his second wife, English actress Talulah Riley, who took him back after confessing she didn't find too many better options.) The local gossip paper ValleyWag has taken many swipes against Musk in the past, to his great displeasure; there are some question marks over his academic credentials (Vance believes the charges to be false); and a trail of former partners and employees who see him as a crazed, sociopathic egotist. One does not save humanity, apparently, without making some enemies.     <br/><br/>How do we judge, then? Is Elon Musk as big as his dreams - a heroic John Galt, besieged by smaller, petty minds, illuminating the way ahead? Or are his ideas about Mars colonies and dangerous AI as tinfoil-hat crazy as they sound to me? My own feeling is that no putative gain is worth sacrificing  the values of humility and humanity, and the belief that no individual is <i>that</i> much greater than the society he inhabits. But I am also clearly not as smart as Musk is, and - perhaps more to the point - he has spent much of his career disproving the skeptics in spectacular fashion. (Both Tesla and SpaceX are currently thriving.) Dare we bet against him now?     ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.2300000000000004,2015,12,533.0

Many historical figures and events appear in this story, based on the poet Novalis and his unconsumated love affair with an inappropriately (especially by today's standards!) underage girl.

So: true Romantics, who we might think this book's natural audience, will found it bloodless and superficial.

(He expresses a touching degree of pride at being an American lecturing to an audience of Europeans, a sentiment readers of his brother will understand...) James comes from the liberal, unitarian Boston that spawned Deists like Emerson and Thoreau - but also with Puritan roots, sporadically burned over by religious revival movements during the 1800s, and in which religion still plays an outsized role in public life when compared to Europe.<br/>Dr James intends to analyze the different existing forms of belief in a detached, scientific way, and much of the book (maybe too much) is given over to testimonies of extreme religious experiences, from which he thinks we can deduce the more moderate types. Unfortunately, here the book suffers from a heavy bias toward Western Christianity. Occasional mention is made of non-Christian worship, but little is made of it.<br/>James is wary of drawing fixed conclusions, committed to a certain relativism that takes into account the variety of human nature, culture and personality. But he is adamant that the religious instinct plays an important role in the human psyche, one that Enlightenment rationalism has not made redundant. In the most powerful moments of hope, fear, ecstasy, altruism or temptation, people are drawn to express some belief in a higher power.<br/>Although secularism is more prevalent today than when these lectures were given, various forms of religious belief show no sign of waning, and some are stronger than ever. If these are positive and valuable, then, is there some specific belief or experience that we should aim towards? Here, James the psychologist is wary of prescribing any doctrinal positions that ought to apply to every person in every situation. He has little interest in the ""science"" of religion, the learned scholasticism of the Middle Ages. But he does very briefly formulate some of his own ideas, a sort of natural religion that requires belief in, and communion with, some power greater than oneself. The infinite varieties of which such being and such communion might be composed, is left to the individual to conceive, in accordance with her own nature.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.019999999999999574,2017,7,488.0

But when you go through all six of these volumes, covering a millenium and a half of the Western world and some of the East, there isn't much time to dwell on specifics.<br/><br/>Thus an audiobook. The benefit ofthe format - that you can power through the boring parts by spacing out - is also its shortcoming: you can space out and miss a lot. These books cover an enormous amount of detail, and there will be parts to bore anyone, be they theological councils or play-by-plays of battles (I prefer the theology any day). But in between this is the foundation of modern Europe. Gibbon may have been famous for his (then) controversial attacks on Christianity (scepticism about the scale of early Christian martyrdom in particular, and a general dissatisfaction with the Church's lack of interest in secular learning), but this is not a one-dimensional tale of glorious Classicism descending into the boorishness of bishops, barbarians and Saracens. We see classical Rome disappear in fits and starts, replaced by 'Barbarians' - some good, some bad, some brave and wise, some not. Gibbon isn't afraid to dive deeply into Islamic history and show non-Christian points of view. The capital is overrun, moves to Ravenna and Constantinople, the Church splits, and eventually, somehow, we are in the 16th c. There's far too much material for me to remember here, far too many beautifully crafted sentences (check out Justin Evans' superb reviews of these books for more on that) to quote. But at least I got a flyover tour of fifteen centuries of history I'd known little about. Plus, hey: now I can say, <i>I did it</i>.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.02,2017,5,311.0

(Here’s the secret: judicious use of adverbs!)  Topics covered here include the birth of commercial flight (with the standard-bearer being Charles Lindbergh, a surly and taciturn man who was nonetheless universally revered before he became a Nazi sympathizer); Babe Ruth (plying his trade next to Lou Gehrig) going on his final record-busting streak; the Sacco-Vinzetti trial; the invention of commercially viable television, and much more. There’s lots of fun historical trivia, but the real draw is Bryson’s deadpan character sketches, like the lazy President Coolidge and his grasping sidekick (and future replacement) Herbert Hoover. <br/><br/>I’m not sure if the summer of 1927 was a particularly memorable one, or if Bryson could wield these talents on any given timeframe to similar results. At 600 pages, there might even be too much going on in this book - especially towards the end, where the cycle of “introduce topic with dramatic hyperbole -> find some wacky facts about the principals -> summarise denouement” becomes faster and a little tiresome.

Entrepeneurial brio! Cosmpolitan, Western-educated citizens taking on the country's development problems and transforming it into the next great power! <br/><br/>It's easy to forget the staggering levels of poverty in the country, the starvation, the homelessness, the near-serfdom of poorer provinces, the lack of sewage facilities. In essence that contradiction is what this book seeks to take on.<br/><br/>This is a quick and readable book, often funny, often exciting, written in the voice of its scantily educated hero. I got through it over two long train rides.<br/><br/>The author was born in India but left at a young age, returning as an adult to write for Time magazine.

Where other countries have a ""service culture"", India has something of a ""servility culture"": desparately poor servants are acculturated to expect awful treatment from their masters and accept it as their lot in life. It is, for the unacquainted (like me), quite horrific.<br/> <br/>The hero of this book is someone who has pulled himself out otf his bondage by committing a heinous crime (alluded to early on). He discusses his society, in a book-length letter to the Chinese Premier, with cynicism and anger. He has no Raskolnikov-like pangs of guilt. Having gotten a miserable lot in life, penned into a prison from which there are no legal means of escape, surrounded by corruption and thuggery, he ""breaks bad"". The author claims that there are many such men and women in India.

Ross weaves biographical details, politics and philosophy into his stories, showing the development of the avant-garde from Wagnerian pomp to twisted Romanticism (<i>Salome</i>, <i>Wozzeck</i>), to ethnic/folk revival (Bartók, Janáček), to dodecaphony (Schoenberg’s peak-Modernism insistence on using every note in the octave in equal measure) and atonality, to Minimalism in forms more (Philip Glass) or less (La Monte Young) palatable (someone at a Steve Reich premiere got up and shouted “Stop, stop, I confess!”), to the kitchen-sink broad-mindedness of Harry Partch, and to today’s globally-inspired, post-everything smorgasbord (albeit playing to a shrinking and graying audience).

Snow's 'two cultures' - science and art. A Romanticist, he struggled to fit within his nature the dry and mechanical nature of the science of his time, which saw nature as a Cartesian machine run by a remote watchmaker Deity. His response to this was to reinvent what science meant. A spirit of adventure led him to South America and Siberia from where he wrote stirring poetic descriptions of the natural world. <br/><br/>Humboldt wasn't the first person to find enchantment in nature. In fact, the anti-enlightenment Romanticism which inspired him had made natural beauty a key part of its anti-industrial spirit. But Humboldt was the first scientist to see his calling as something compatible with natural wonder, and one of his books, <i>Cosmos</i>, inspired the same wonder in his generation as its <a href = ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos_(disambiguation)#Television"">namesake TV shows</a> did in our times. His new approach also opened his eyes to some of the hypocrisies of his time: slavery, colonialism, the degradation of the environment. (A lifelong liberal, his admiration for the US was matched by his abhorrence for its toleration of slavery.)<br/><br/>This book is about not just Humboldt's life, but also those that he inspired, including Darwin, Thoreau, George Marsh, Ernst Haeckel (whose <i>Kunstformen der Natur</i> was a major influence on the floral curves of the Art Nouveau), and John Muir, the ""patron saint"" of environmentalism. Our vision of nature has changed from that of an attractive backdrop to that of a dynamic, vulnerable system which may not be around forever. This book artfully and engagingly tracks this awakening, a story as much about imagination as science and society.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.33999999999999986,2017,2,295.0

This might quickly become tedious (I was starting to get tired of it by page 20) until one realises that, sneakily, the study of Lawrence is starting to take shape behind the scenes. As Dyer stalks the exotic locales where his study lived, he uses quotes from Lawrence's letters and diaries, along with references to his contemporaries and influences (Rilke, Camus), to portray an image of Lawrence the relentless cynic, a perpetual émigré who could never quite be happy anywhere. (I am currently reading the diaries of Kenneth Tynan and starting to worry that this might be an English thing.) And there is something deeper. By the end of the book, Dyer gropes with his battle with depression, his need for a cause to battle against, a resentment against the world that enables him to escape a pit of nihilistic despair. And then follows up with a comprehensive bibliography: apparently the job was done, taking shape not despite his frustration, but in fact, its very incarnation.

Poised at the edge of the abyss, it seems not to want to take sides, merely to point out how strange it all is.  ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.3900000000000001,2016,10,130.0

My style on here is usually to give my gut response to the book, trying to surface the two or three most pressing responses I experienced while reading it, and eschewing plot summaries or informed background, and thus somewhat lacking in the strengths of either of the methods mentioned above, though hopefully still with some appeal to aesthetic types who privilege experience over information.<br/><br/>Anyhow, this book came with some high expectations for me, coming from the pen of n+1 founding editor Chad Harbach. (I've previously reviewed here novels by Keith Gessen and Ben Kunkel.) Those were confounded, in a good way, by what is basically a riproaring yarn, a classic, near-mythical sports novel which pits a hard-working underdog team against big-money opponents - and I'd never dream of spoiling what happens next. Let me reiterate that: this is a gripping sports story, and I know absolutely nothing about baseball (coming from a cricket-playing country).<br/><br/>There are some elements of the author's American Studies background: a Melville motif wraps itself around the college, and there is a Whitman-infused love affair between two men. Some of the vocabulary is beautifully precise, frequently flummoxing my e-reader. But this is essentially not a challenging novel; not social satire, not puncturing intellectual pretensions, nary a word of Theory crossing onto its pages. Its a page-turner suited for all readers. Its heart is in the 1950s (where it could be transferred, with the scrubbing of strangely few modern references), where its all-American heroes could be found more often, taking to the flawless green diamond, for all the world like Greek warriors headed for Troy.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.0099999999999998,2016,9,314.0

The lack of emotional resonance bothered me, but this is an alienated book about a near post-human life. The writer, like Beckett, is a fluent French speaker, and ice-cold, crisp prose abounds. I'll close with a fairly representative quote (about the narrator's son):<br/><br/><blockquote>But no name. Unguentine refused.

Friend's spiel is essentially that he comes from American nobility, a venerable WASP clan that primed him for greatness exactly at the moment that its empire was crumbling under the blows of meritocracy and transparency. (Crumbling, though even today one supposes, not completely crumbled.) But in practice this book is a regular family memoir, told with sensitivity, nostalgia and affection, though not bereft of criticism. Friend exemplifies the positive traits of his, uh, ethnicity? clan? cohort? - but is keenly aware of the negatives - scandals kept secret, bad marriages, repression, racism, alcoholism. Meandering through the story of his privileged upbringing, stopping to examine childhood homes, back-stories of minor relatives, fizzled relationships and lost years: in the hands of a lesser writer, this could become quite a drag. But Friend is a gifted writer, wielding his intelligence carefully, and writing with kindness, wit and an understated grace. So the story starts to feel almost like a lost memory, on a lawn by the beach, where the reader came of age, feeling the ocean swell and the sting of homesickness with each turn of the page.

Whose responsibility is this thing, anyway?<br/><br/>That question seems to be the basic premise in this funny, whip-smart short story, originally published in <i>Harper's</i> magazine. But it's difficult to relate to it without mentioning the pachyderm in the quarters: Wallace's own depression and eventual suicide. The story's ending (spoiler alert, but c'mon, it's like eight pages) shows the neediness of the depressed person to be even more thoughtless and craven than we first realised - but what else would we expect when the author identifies so strongly with the self-loathing of his character?<br/><br/>Perhaps the picture isn't quite so bleak as it's made out to be here.

Clark is an outstanding historian who doesn't flinch from minute detail - the opening chapters give an exhausting account of the Serbian nationalist movement, and it gets more complicated from there. There are moments of narrative, such as the infamous assassination; interesting bits about the history of masculinity in the early 20th c., and a couple of historiographical meditations on the difficulty of assigning causes as a historian - the various schools of who was to blame are considered and rejected. The war cannot be seen as inevitable, nor can it be seen as entirely out of the blue. <br/><br/>But most of this book is a meticulous reconstruction of the political and military situations of Europe's Great Powers prior to the war. There is a lot of detail, threatening to overwhelm, and I'm not sure how much of it I'll retain. But I'll throw out here a few reasons for the war: a) French revanchism stemming from the Franco-Prussian War of 1870; b) France's increasing diplomatic nous since the death of Bismarck, culminating in its harnessing Russia and Britain in the Entente Cordiale; c) German belligerence, fuelled by Prussian militarism, the lack of foreign colonies and the ensuing desire for a ""place in the sun""; d) the desire of autocratic leaders to push off domestic issues (Home Rule in Britain, the discontent of the serfs in Russia) with a war; and e) the pre-industrial belief in both the glory and containability of war - the belief that the boys would be home by Christmas. Thus, a regional quarrel between Austro-Hungary and Russia was escalated by Germany and France, triggering Germany's violation of Belgian neutrality to attack France, and thus Britain's involvement. There - not so hard, is it, Chris?<br/><br/>In all seriousness, though, this is a first-rate history book recommended for history buffs only.

Winslow deftly and thoroughly portrays how the drug trade has wrapped its tendrils around Mexico, yet at the same time life continues as normal for many in richer areas. The story is taken in many cases from the news, and includes plentiful details about real cartels such as the Zetas, and also about inter-agency politics, or the Mérida Initiative, or the 2012 Mexican elections.<br/><br/>To draw a slightly more obvious TV parallel, it's also a bit like <i>Breaking Bad</i>.

Oh yes, answers the host, in fact we know exactly what the future holds. The problem is the past: that keeps changing.<br/><br/>Tony Judt relates this joke in the closing essay of this mammoth, disparate history. While ostensibly about the shifting memory of the Holocaust, that epilogue makes some attempt at a thematic summation of what has come before. Beginning in the ruins of World War II, this book has swept through the concurrent processes of Denazification and Stalinisation, the fall of the Eastern Bloc under Soviet control, the triumph of Social Democrats in Western Europe, the Left's disillusionment with Communism and turn to postcolonialism, the beginning of the EEC and EU, the fall of the USSR, and much else besides. <br/><br/>Judt is a brilliant writer: his erudition seemingly bottomless, his style cool and readable. His instinct for the interesting is also spot on. Never getting bogged down in statistics, he will rebound from a political point to an intellectual one, reference a novel or a film of the period, carefully pass out an aesthetic judgment. Each chapter groans under its load of epigraphs. Here, at heart, is a literary soul, not a military or economic historian, though his command of these subjects is redoubtable. All the pieces connect, and the jumble of facts most of us have about this half-century coheres into a fluid storyline, evolving in neat and logical steps.<br/><br/>In fact if there is any criticism to be made of this book, it would be that it is possibly <i>too</i> neat. Judt is so omniscient-seeming, and so confident, that one can forget that there are always other sides to the story. The Left comes in for plenty of criticism, sure - but Conservatives (not counting Nationalists and neo-Nazis) are almost entirely absent. Much of the middle of this book portrays Western European politics as a battle between Social Democrats and Communists. I don't know enough to say for sure, but I suspect there were other parties present, who simply don't interest this historian as much. Later on, predictably, Judt excoriates Thatcher, and gives short shrift to the Clinton/Blair neoliberal Third Way. Certainly a justifiable assessment, but this does seem to leave some gaps, to be filled in by some putative equally ambitious historian.<br/><br/>If only! Judt tragically succumbed to Lou Gehrig's disease a few years ago, just 62. The last few years have posed fresh, increasingly difficult questions to the European project; casting doubts on the pluralist optimism Judt espouses at this book's close. Sadly, he is not around to apply his mind to them, and the large hole he left remains unfilled.   <br/> <br/>P.S. I listened to Ralph Cosham's gloriously patrician audiobook reading: it added to the sensation of being in attendance at an elite and gripping lecture.

True, the far less talented Edison did try run him out of business with inferior technology during the 'War of the Currents', and he had to put up with patent trolls such as Guglielmo Marconi (who at point lived on a boat, to avoid being served a summons). But Tesla was also snobby and easily offended, a spendthrift, prone to mood swings and bouts of paranoia. Much of his life was spent fighting lawsuits and foreclosure, and struggling to finance his ambitious invention. A slightly more moderate personality would have probably been able to close some early deals, compromise when necessary, and free up his days for leisurely inventing.

But its ancient name is Oxus, whence comes the title of this book. It is also known to various cultures as Vaksha and Wehrod. This confluence of civilisations well reflects the rich diversity of the regions in which this book takes place - Persian, Greek, Turkic, Indian, Chinese. <br/><br/>This travelogue, specifically, does not welcome the lazy reader. Byron was well-educated - he  had studied at the Oriental Institute after dropping out of Oxford, and spoke some Persian. He jumps straight into things, assuming the reader is familiar with the broad outlines of Central Asian history and architecture, and filling in the finer details. His aesthetic judgement is informed and unafraid. <br/>After being stood up by some friends testing a coal-driven car, and intermittently accompanied by friend Christopher Sykes, Byron makes his way from Venice to Palestine, via Cyprus, and then heads through Syria and Iraq to (then) Persia, finally heading east to Afghanistan. His goal is to reach the Oxus river - southern border of Transoxiana, the boundary of Russia's sphere of influence - but he is not allowed to reach it. The reason stated by the various officials getting in his way is that he and Christopher are suspected of being spies, but at the end, Byron discovers the truth. The Russians and the English have arranged that neither country's citizens are allowed in the other's sphere of influence (no-one had exactly conquered Afghanistan or India, but the Great Game for control of Central Asia, the 'heartland' of Eurasia, was in full swing). Byron disparages this agreement together with a Russian he runs into.<br/><br/>By googling a <i>lot</i>, I picked up plenty of history from this book. (Byron's antiquated spelling frequently led to quotes from this book being the only search result.) The author's sneering condescension for his subaltern environments is anachronistic, but he also has real appreciation for the (natural and man-made) beauty he sees. His lengthy discussion of architectural features can sometimes be a little monotonous. Still, the adventurous spirit and timeless wonder conveyed through these pages is enough to inspire in the reader the urge to dust off one's passport and head out the door. Small wonder that many travel writers still consider it their bible.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.08000000000000007,2016,2,426.0

Miller|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348818961s/8117484.jpg|12912907], this book presents something of a compressed Grand History of humanity, and attempts to draw from it answers to big questions. Its author, who received his Ph.D. in Archaeology, now teaches History and Classics in sunny Stanford and in his spare time, per <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/In-Ian-Morriss-Big-History/137415/"">this</a> engrossing <i>Chronicle of Higher Ed</i> piece, consults to  CIA spooks and Kissingerian foreign policy realist types (von Clausewitz, the father of them all, gets name-checked repeatedly).<br/><br/>In sum, the argument put forward is that - <i>contra</i> the song lyric that gives this book its title - war is actually very, very important in the Whiggish march toward peace and prosperity. Taking the side of Hobbes over Rousseau, and eliciting Jane Goodall's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gombe_Chimpanzee_War"">warring chimps</a> as evidence, Morris claims that the natural state of human beings is relentlessly violent, and that it is only through the rise of governmental Leviathans (Morris likes the term ""stationary bandits"", and later, ""globocops"") able to monopolise violence, that periods of peace can (and invariably do!) develop.  Thus the Roman or Ming Empires, through ruthless conquest and iron fists, ultimately brought about much more peaceful societies than those that had preceded them.<br/><br/>Morris' theory, like all such ambitious ones, will have plenty of critics, who will find much to critique in the generalisations and inaccuracies found in any such a coarse-grained history. However, he goes much further. The last section of the book lays out a picture of the geostrategic issues facing today's world, and some predictions about how technology, and political forces, might play out over the next few decades. It has been my experience that in the social sciences, forecasts beyond the immediate term, even by complete experts, are always wrong. (This is my First, and Last, Law of Forecasting.) Myriad confounders and ""unknown unknowns"" always arise to surprise even the most logical expectations. I was thus disappointed that Morris decided to go down this route at all. His last chapter reads like imaginative, over-excited science fiction, setting aside caution and predicting a world of post-human AI and nuclear battlefields. Even gazing into the past, as this book illustrates, is a complex and difficult task. Gazing into the future is for fools.  ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.040000000000000036,2016,2,377.0

Conway,"=""1596916109""","=""9781596916104""",4,4.17,Bloomsbury Press,Hardcover,357.0,2010.0,2010.0,2016/01/07,2016/01/18,"economics, science-and-mathematics","economics (#21), science-and-mathematics (#10)",read,"It's rare that a highly partisan book on a controversial issue can so utterly convince me of the rightness of its cause, so the authors of this book deserve credit for the work they've done, which strikes a balance between relentless scientific fact-citing, damning historical evidence, and some careful, nuanced discussions on market failures, the tragedy of the commons, and the exact definition of proof in empirical research. <br/><br/>""Why can't scientists stop contradicting themselves?"" I wrote to a scientist friend a few years back, frustrated with the conflicting reports I kept hearing about anthropogenic climate change. He responded with righteous umbrage, and stacks of data points, and links to unwieldy PDFs that I'd never more than scan. It seemed like for people in the know, the evidence clearly pointed one way: but then why did so many seemingly intelligent people still harbour doubts? It is primarily this question that this book sets out to explain.<br/><br/>Beginning with the tobacco industry's fight against the link between smoking and diseases, the authors recap the genesis of the idea that scientific evidence that threatens a company's income could be deflected by sowing the seeds of doubt. Astonishingly, it is many of the same people - disgruntled or maverick scientists, or those who feared that environmentalist threats to business could be the vanguard of socialist threats to freedom (the ""green tree with red roots"") - and funding from many of the same think tanks, that connect the threads between the fight against the science of smoking, acid rain, DDTs, missile defence, and global warming. Owing to the fact that fields such as epidemiology and meteorology must, by definition, always draw their conclusions based on statistical correlations and induction from large data sets, and cannot be proved in the same way as, say, Newtonian mechanics, the eponymous ""merchants of doubt"" sowed sceptical seeds, utilising their scientific reputations and the media's desire to show both sides of any story to convince the public that things were complicated, and that we ought not to rush into any rash decisions. ""More research is needed,"" ran their mantra. To obfuscate is always easier than to clarify.<br/><br/>This campaign extended to maligning the reputation of many prominent scientists (and journalists such as Rachel Carson), assigning murky motivations to researchers who had toiled in obscure fields for decades, and insisting on denying the weight of evidence years beyond the point where consensus had been reached within the scientific community. Its results have been disproportionately successful. Only recently, as the public has become more aware of the one-directionality of the evidence, has more of an impetus to action been seen, most recently in the COP 21 conference in Paris. This book clarifies much about the disconnect between technical scientific research and public understanding, and the need for clear communication channels between scientists and the public, in the absence of which malicious actors will manipulate the confusion for their own ends. It is far from clear what can be done to remedy this situation. But for this non-scientist reader, it is a huge gain just to be aware of the problem.

Dealing with  issues as diverse as the Dreyfus Affair, Richard Strauss and the annexation of Hawaii, she shows the ideological changes coming to consciousness in the western mind, leading to greater democracy and egalitarianism, but with the background of the martial drumbeat that led ultimately to the Great War.

It's a shame that Dyson's narration is erratic, leaning too heavily into academic politics (the high-minded humanists of the IAS in Princeton resented the presence of engineers [government-affiliated, to boot] in their midst), and then skimming over some of the complex ideas discussed too quickly, at least, for this reader to follow. Some of the ideas are astonishing. For example: modern computers use an archaic address architecture based mainly on the arbitrary specs of early computers. Could a more efficient and sophisticated computing follow nature's methods - such as the RNA system which commands a protein to move a certain number of steps,  without being tied down to a location? (At least I think that's the gist of it.) Other ideas are quite airy. Dyson extends the biology-electronics metaphor, suggesting  that today's apps form a kind of symbiotic lifeform transferring digital knowledge from humans to the growing digital mind. (I think that the cathedral of the title is a reference to the Googleplex, where, as labradors leap through fountains and unnervingly happy people wander around, our minds are slowly fusing with the Singularity.)

""Modern CEOs get paid far in excess of their actual contribution to the companies they run."" Your feelings on this issue  probably say a lot about what you feel about the economy, wealth inequality, and the merits of free markets in general. Top executives receiving huge salary packages for doing what seems like a pretty cushy job instinctively feels unjust to many - but then, no-one is forcing companies to pay such high salaries, so where exactly is the issue?<br/>   <br/>This sort of highlights the tension between social justice and neoliberalism ongoing in political debates. This book is, on the one hand, a rigorous academic tome, with what is for non-economists a daunting amount of equations and terms of art. Yet it is also in a sense a work of economic history (with a smattering of references to Austen and Balzac, and the film <i>Titanic</i>), dating back to the political economy tradition of the nineteenth century, when the young field was (or aspired to be) more about polemic and ideology than quantitative models. That tradition also includes Marx, who Piketty seeks to emulate, though he dispenses with the former's Hegelian Grand Theories of History.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, Piketty's platform much more resembles that of a far less divisive figure: Henry George, whose [b: Progress and Poverty|552175|Progress and Poverty|Henry George|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1266583662s/552175.jpg|539415] was one of the revolutionary works of economics of the late nineteenth century. George saw the greatest source of economic injustice as the collection of rent by land-owners, whose wealth rises without any investment, simply as land becomes more useful. He proposed a land-value tax, to soak these profiteers (who comprised the bulk of the upper class of his time) and provide a basic income for all.<br/><br/>Piketty, more cautiously, seeks to apply the same principle to all capital, be it securities, trust funds or houses in the Hamptons. Following Marx, he claims that the fundamental equation of capitalism is r > g; that is, the growth of capital exceeds that of the economy as a whole, and thus the growth of income from labour. In a sweeping look at financial records from the developed world over several centuries, he shows that - although at many times this has not obtained, due to exogenous shocks (world wars, say) or periods of rapid growth (France's <i>Trente Glorieuses</i>) - in periods of regular growth, capital will tend to aggregate more quickly than the rest of the economy; particularly when the wealthy are able to hire investment whizzes who can beat the market, while ""the average man receives investing advice from his brother-in-law"".<br/><br/>Without a change in course, a new Gilded Age such as ours might continue to produce skewed outcomes, leading to increased social unrest and ultimately the system burning itself out (if capital's share of growth continues to increase, some point must be reached at which there is nothing left, and the only choices are imperialism or collapse). Piketty thus proposes a global wealth tax, which would prevent the incentives for capital flight to offshore tax havens (the reason that so many corporations are headquartered in Delaware or Dublin is not because of their love of Guinness and Riverdance).<br/><br/>What's most notable about Piketty is how radical he isn't: no David Graeber or Harvey, he is a former MIT professor who stands firmly in the French centre, though not the American one. He understands why economists believe so firmly in markets, and his case against them is built firmly on empirical data. Of course, predictions are always inexact, and the next few decades could confound any model we could imagine. But this book is a superbly researched, clear-headed addition to the conversation on inequality, and the questions it raises demand urgent answers. It may soon to be late.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.040000000000000036,2015,11,623.0

So how did he become a celebrity, an idol, even a sex symbol? Today, accustomed to anodyne and anonymous DC wonks, we can't even imagine a ""superstar diplomat"".<br/><br/>I think the reason lies in the palpable climate of fear of the Cold War-gripped 1970s. The USSR was, for all people knew, very close to conquering the world, resulting in either nuclear apocalypse or totalitarian slavery. Into that milieu stepped Kissinger, with his radiant self-confidence, professorial genius and diplomatic savvy, and became something of a Messiah.<br/><br/>One shouldn't understate his actual achievements. His ability to butter up the press and foreign leaders allowed him to conduct Machiavellian intrigues, often with some success. But if we credit him with those successes, we must also hold against him the prolongation of the Vietnam War, the destabilisation of Cambodia and resultant Khmer Rouge terror, and many other horrific failures.<br/><br/>Today, people either pillory him (Christopher Hitchens and others on the left), or ignore him. That is fitting - without the threat of nuclear war, we can see more clearly through his bluster and lies. Attention would only feed his overstuffed ego. Kissinger was not exceptional or interesting, except as a self publicist.<br/><br/>I came into this book knowing very little about him, and was surprised by the antipathy I developed as I read it. Politics today are still full of prevarication. Even the ""experts"" usually just hide crystal ball reading behind some trendy jargon. But happily, the prophets of international relations are less revered nowadays than once they were.

The author's breadth of knowledge is incredible, and he uses his broader understanding of the History of Ideas to inform his portrayal of individual philosophers - showing how Hegel's Idealism was influenced by and influenced German Romaticism, or how Hobbes' skepticism about people's innate goodness emerged from the political turbulence which he experienced. <br/><br/>In a fascinating introduction, he analyses the relation between philosophy and the history of philosophy (a far more critical one than that between, say, physics and the history of physics). Since philosophy is not a progression, but a series of iterations on the same themes, the ideas contained in Plato or Descartes are as relevant today as ever. However, there is an important distinction between the history that is relevant to a philosopher, and that which is of interest to the historian of ideas. The idea, to use Scruton's example, of there being more than one God, while of great historical importance, need no longer detain the student of philosophy for very long.<br/><br/>As one of the most prominent Anglophone philosophers to deal with aesthetics, Scruton is ideally posed to present both the Continental and the Analytical traditions fairly - giving a far more nuanced presentation, for example, of the ideas of Hegel than Bertrand Russell's pugnacious history does. The presence of that latter book appears quite a few times here: Scruton uses Russell as a foil, receiving from him his humourous, clear style, yet maintaining a commitment to a semblance of ecumenicalism.<br/><br/>Still, this book is not entirely without subjectivity. Often Scruton couches his logical flow in a sort of dialectic between a philosopher and a sceptical interlocutor - and shows his own preference by his choice of whom to award the last word. (Sections ending in a philosopher seeming to be a mess of contradictions are dismayingly common.) But it is inevitable that one should show prejudice when schematising a view one finds inadmissible, and Scruton is careful to bring out the heritage of each thinker he presents, both from a historical and a contemporary perspective.<br/><br/>The presentations of Leibniz and Spinoza in particular are a masterwork of clarity, and the section on Kant is as good as can be expected, when dealing with ideas the meaning of which nobody is actually sure.

He still lost me with some of the particle physics stuff. <br/><br/>Feynman started his academic career as a precocious math undergrad at Princeton, and went to the pinnacle of modern science, first at the Manhattan Project and later designing a daunting freshman physics curriculum at CalTech later published as ""Six Easy Pieces"". His career neatly parallels the modern perception of science: theoretical physics was transformed from a discipline akin, in practical application, to ""medieval French"", to a near-religion, captivating the awed respect of the public, and leading to enormous increases in governmental research spending and the development of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Science"">""Big Science""</a>. And later, as the pace of new developments dropped, and scientists, confronted with an ever-increasing list of particles, gradually gave up on  finding a unified theory of the atom, more mystical and antiscientific thinking gradually re-emerged. <br/><br/>Notable personal aspects of Feynman were his pre-feminist attitudes toward women, culminating in protests at some of his public talks, and, related, his near-constant womanising. (He never recovered emotionally from the death of his beloved first wife.) Also worth noting is that his quips and stories, seemingly off-the-cuff, were carefully rehearsed in his notebooks.<br/><br/>All of which shouldn't take away from the scope of his genius. Gleick sees his subject as the genius <i>par excellence</i>, akin to Einstein and Newton (the latter a previous biographical subject). He devotes a chapter in the final section to a fascinating discussion of the nature and history of ""genius"". Feynman's thinking was, in speed and clarity, unlike that of normal people.<br/><br/>One final point: in an interview with the BBC retold by Gleick, Feynman becomes quite agitated when asked to explain in layman's terms how magnets work. He insists that they just work. This is quite out of the ordinary, as in every other regard Feynman seemed to consider the ability to explain something in simple terms as the hallmark of a clear understanding.

Thiel ends off the lecture series on which the book is based, thus:<br/><br/> <blockquote>In a very real sense, the life of every person is a singularity.<br/><br/>The obvious question is what you should do with your singularity. The obvious answer, unfortunately, has been to follow the well-trodden path. You are constantly encouraged to play it safe and be conventional...But the obvious answer is wrong...the big secret is that there are many secrets left to uncover. There are still many large white spaces on the map of human knowledge. You can go discover them. So do it. Get out there and fill in the blank spaces. Every single moment is a possibility to go to these new places and explore them. <br/><br/>There is perhaps no specific time that is necessarily right to start your company or start your life. But some times and some moments seem more auspicious than others. Now is such a moment...<br/><br/>Choose to do something important and different. Don’t be deterred by notions of luck, impossibility, or futility. Use your power to shape your own life and go and do new things.</blockquote><br/><br/>There you have it: business school boilerplate as gospel. Those tending toward skepticism (myself included) might be won over by Thiel's phenomenal erudition, his sweeping, ambitious theories of history, and his own personal success. In a time when political and religious leaders seem unable to inspire the confidence of the masses, the self-made wonks - bearing tidings of a trans-human tech Utopia! - are enjoying their moment at last.

Menand combines fascinating personal anecdotes with the political and intellectual history of the time to create a seamless flow of thought, moving logically from one idea to another. (In fact, if there's any criticism to be made of this book, it's that in making everything fit so perfectly, its author elides some of the complexity of his subject matter.) <br/><br/>At the heart of the book is a club briefly formed by Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Charles Sanders Peirce and William James, but the club's antecedents and results are really what the book is about. Menand follows the impact of the Civil War, on the one hand, and scientific developments and the rise of skepticism on the other, in changing the established <i>weltanschauung</i> of the Boston Brahmins and American intelligentsia. The first caused the post-war generation (as wars often do) to turn against ideology. They believed that even noble ideas were not worth such bloody sacrifices. The second, the ideas of statistical probability and regression to the mean, opened a new world: one in which everything was deterministic, but <i>within a certain zone of error</i>; one in which species could evolve through random mutations, with the best characteristics slowly being selected, and in which ideas and societies could similarly evolve through freedom of thought. Thus the idea of a static natural world, which was mirrored by the mind, and a corresponding system of beliefs, was replaced by a more flexible idea of an ever-changing world with no fixed goals or values aside from what is useful, and a mental image which is constructed by the process of the mind's interaction with the world. <br/><br/>Epistomologically, this meant the philosophy of pragmatism (that what is true is merely what it is useful to believe); in jurisprudence, this meant allowing the law to change in accordance with the flux of human experience, and not some unchanging underlying logic which the lawyer must discover. And in policy, as exemplified by John Dewey, this meant a greater openness to social change - a belief that the gaps between thought and action must be bridged. Dewey was famous as an educational reformer, but he also worked to promote the advancement of women and minorities, worker's unions, and pacifism. <br/><br/>These thinkers (and the many others described herein) had many differences - for example, James was famous as a defender of belief in God, something Holmes had little time for - but their views taken as a whole illustrate the sea change which created the modern, pluralist, scientifically (as opposed to theologically) oriented society of today. The ideas (despite the major cultural changes of the Cold War and subsequent events, which Menand touches on in an Epilogue) are an essential part of understanding contemporary culture. This book explains it with pulsating anecdotes and crystal clarity, combining in the best possible way the spirits of the intellectual historian and the raconteur.

But the $64,000 question is: how many of those old-fashioned values do we miss?<br/><br/>Riemen, a devoted student of Thomas Mann, writes with unapologetic nostalgia for the great European culture that was. (In fact, I picked this up after hitting another wall in <i>The Magic Mountain</i>, hoping for succor or at least some insight into the author: I think it might have helped a little.) He makes the case for the German idea of <i>Bildung</i> - which encompasses, but goes far beyond, a liberal arts education - in the face of 20th century nihilism, and moral relativism. And following a little-remembered French philosopher named Julien Benda, he indicts European intellectuals for their induction into politics, and subsequent culpability in the crimes of Nazism and Stalinism.<br/><br/>Deriving from a number of conversations - one from <i>The Magic Mountain</i>, one from the beginning of Plato's <i>Republic</i>, another from Camus's diary, between the young writer, Sartre and André Malraux - Riemen surveys the ways in which intellectuals try to engage politically. Enlightenment rationalist triumphalism, dogmatic humanism, the platonic reign of the philosophers - all have unspooled into horrific tragedies. Rather, he suggests, philosophers ought to keep themselves separate from the public sphere, focusing on art, on the world of Forms, on the never-ending refinement of human knowledge and moral character.<br/><br/>Thus the argument, as far as I got it. The author's sentimentality, the driving force of his rhetorical engine, sometimes comes at the cost of cogency. Without further evidence, it's hard to accept his claim that past European authors and thinkers possessed some intangible ideal of greatness now lost to us. But that shouldn't detract from his arguments for greater moral courage and the depoliticisation of art. To reject out of hand anything we may learn from the old European morality is to err on the side of Whiggism; to do the opposite is utterly anachronistic.

Reducing whole nations to a few characteristics is a dangerous game, but never feels more right than when done by Kate Fox, an anthropologist whose keen intellect shines through this book, despite her commendable repudiation of academic jargon and pretension. With typically English humour and modesty (or so her book would have it) she explains her project, an anthropological survey of domestic English life, as merely the laziest and safest option available.<br/><br/>In short, she sees the single defining core of the English as ""social dis-ease"", in response to which they have developed a number of coping mechanisms - primarily an all-pervasive sense of humour, and a strong belief in courtesy (often manifested 'negatively', i.e leaving people alone). She identifies English values such as common sense, a tendency to 'Eeyorish' gloominess (the ""typical!"" syndrome), and a powerful class-consciousness (though it isn't acceptable to talk about this last one publicly).<br/><br/>Occasionally Fox's obvious fondness for her subject can take away from her objectivity - she has quite a few fuzzy rationalisations or jokey excuses for things of which an objective observer of a faraway tribe might take a more jaundiced view. But of course, this is something of an insider's book - for either English people, or those keenly familiar with them. I found plenty of myself in this book: my tendency to apologise too much, my need for privacy, my moderate and reasonably common-sensical outlook on life (what Fox dubs ""Empiricism"").

Vedral has boundless enthusiasm for his subject matter, but lacks any sense of style (you can almost hear the cadence of his native Serbia in his prose), tends towards weak jokes, and sometimes takes for granted the reader's understanding of quite difficult, unfamiliar concepts. (The concept of entanglement, for example, is not explained once. I thought it was the same as superposition.)<br/><br/>So there were parts of this book that went above my head, but the thrust of it is three ideas. First, the role of information as the defining, interdisciplinary quantity of all the sciences. The building blocks of everything in the universe are information, be it physical matter, biological (DNA), or social. He outlines Claude Shannon's theory of information and ""entropy"" (an apocryphal tale has John von Neumann suggesting the name to him on the grounds that no-one understands what it means). Secondly, the quantum phenomena of uncertainty exhibited at the subatomic level, and the possibilities of quantum information (a quantum bit is called, quite Biblically, the ""qubit"") in computing and in broader contexts (teleportation, for one).<br/><br/>Lastly, in a speculative third section, he muses on quantum information theory's ability to answer the problem of creation <i>ex nihilo</i>, avoiding the problem of infinite regress (who moves the first mover?) by suggesting that a chance differentiation in an original Void could at one fell swoop create physical information and the laws which govern it. Seeing as the laws are created by our interactions with nature, ever susceptible to Popperian falsification, and nature exists according to the laws, the two exist in a cycle, in which an observer is necessary to both measure matter and to cause it to exist. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the amount of order in the universe tends ever downward, yet life, through natural selection fights against that entropy every day. Professor Vedral suggests that during the lifetime of that struggle, we may glimpse far enough back to see the origins of our universe and its physical laws as parts of a giant computer, slowly spinning through its finite information, on the path from and to nothingness.

His story-telling is engaging, but the ending, in which one of the crusading traders starts a new private exchange in which all trades occur at the same time, seems a little frustratingly dull.

Is it political science? History? Sociology? Arendt's eclectic skill reflects a vanished age of academic versatility, and a very healthy estimation of her own ability. Drawing together classical and literary references, crowd psychology, and a broad historical view, she describes the origins of anti-Semitism as a political movement in Central Europe, the political ramifications of the decline and rise of the bourgeoisie, and the ways in which totalitarianism came to be seen as a viable system of government. In her view, totalitarian governments exist as a sort of personification of the mob, in which the leader's orders, even if clearly irrational and immoral, contain an arresting logic which inspires blind obedience. <br/><br/>Ultimately, she defines totalitarianism as a response to loneliness felt by individuals collected in a crowd and thus, though the Second World War made unlikely the prospect of future totalitarian governments, the conditions which led to them are still present. This isn't a hopeful book, nor is it, from what I understand, the clearest guide to the history of totalitarianism, but it is beautifully written, full of quotable passages and magnificent lines. Arendt, like many post-war German émigrés (Adorno, Mann, Horkheimer...), is a brooding Cassandra, spinning a dark and subjective vision of man, bolstered with references from her encyclopedic mind.

On the book's cover, each of the characters faces away from the centre; indeed, a very superficial reader might leave this book with the impression that the characters don't much like each other. But that would be to mistake their very British reserve for lack of compassion. On the contrary, there is so much compassion in the awkward way that the four retired protagonists connect. Their thoughts run unbidden to one another, the tiny echoes of past interactions, in the absence of pressing current concerns, dictate their inner (and outer) lives.<br/><br/>Pym's ability to write the quotidian rhythm of life without losing the reader is both artistic triumph and a reaction to the hegemony of the young. Away from the current of social change of 1970s England (though not unaware of it), away from the passion of youth and the caprice of narrative, <i>Quartet in Autumn</i> finds humanity and hope in quiet and unnoticed lives. ""In life we are become death,"" thinks one of the characters, but this book's vitality reverses that, drawing the continued possibility of change and growth from some forgotten place between office drudgery and the grave.

His past is complex, described piecemeal over the course of the book, and the narrator's reliability is questionable. The hero repeats like a mantra his materialist and positivist creed in which science is the only truth worth seeking. But the more he repeats it, the less confident he sounds. Living in Manhattan - the city of the future <i>par excellence</i>, a place to leave behind Europe and the past - he meets, through a series of co-incidences, a string of former friends from before World War II. He flees his emotionally needy mistress into the arms of a stranger he meets on a boat to Europe. She, in turn, may or may not be his daughter...<br/><br/>Clearly, it's difficult to summarise the plot, which is disorienting, intentionally rambling and unfocused. Frisch's tight, fragmentary prose displays the fragility so close to the surface of his hero. Believing in a life without a past and without meaning, he struggles to build emotional connections, or even to make peace with himself. He writes: ""I didn't want to kill myself, because I would still have lived, and I wanted never to have existed."" A bleak vision of a past seeping through the floorboards.

But this book has some extraordinary factual claims: willpower, long ignored by social scientists (who preferred to attribute achievements to environmental factors), is something like a muscle, which can be carefully managed or tired out, as well as trained. The authors survey people with great willpower (recovering addicts, endurance artists, Victorian explorers) and discuss ways to understand and improve your chances in your inner struggles. Particularly fascinating is the role of religion, a kind of ""outsourcing"" of willpower which was the most effective way of achieving it, and its contemporary absence has made it harder for people to force themselves to achieve their goals. (Consider the mysterious belief-mandatory success of AA - which still puzzles psychologists - familiar to readers of [b: Infinite Jest|6759|Infinite Jest|David Foster Wallace|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1425412159s/6759.jpg|3271542].) The authors also caution against dieting, which makes us fight our most basic desire, hunger, a fight we are evolutionarily guaranteed to lose. Instead they recommend trade-offs, delaying gratification by promising ourselves we will eat more if we wait a few hours.<br/><br/>I'm not a harangued professional struggling to cope with emails, but I do have my own willpower struggles - [b: Death in Venice|53061|Death in Venice|Thomas Mann|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1410132000s/53061.jpg|17413130] or check my Twitter feed? - so I'll be happy if I am even a little successful in implementing this book's suggestions.

That's the crux of this book, in which a Nobel laureate explains the discoveries which led to the founding of behavioural economics - which states that people are not utility-maximising <i>homo economicus</i>, but instead behave in (predictably) irrational ways. Kahneman admits that, even after his research, he isn't much better at avoiding these errors, but thinks that understanding them can help us understand ourselves better, and perhaps create better public policy.<br/><br/>In a way, our humanity can be defined as a hybrid of rationality and emotion. I'm not sure that rejecting all irrational ideas will lead us to greater net happiness. This finds expression in the ongoing contemporary debate about the value of the humanities. The humanist finds value in things which cannot always be reduced to algebraic truth-functions. But perhaps these are all materialist phenomena, explained by neurochemistry? <br/><br/>Another point: listening to <a href=""http://philosophybites.com/2015/03/lisa-bortolotti-on-irrationality.html"">a discussion</a> on irrationality led me to think about how agency is to an extent predicated on the capacity for rational action. Liberal philosophers who argue for human freedoms must assume that people are capable of judging their own best interests. Otherwise, they should allow authoritarian-minded technocrats to ""nudge"" people into objectively better choices. <br/><br/>All of these issues are complex, and I'm sure that I'm not doing them justice here, but I think they are relevant to the subtext of this book, and to our current scientifically oriented climate. This shouldn't prejudice one's expectations of this book, with which this review hasn't dealt much. So here goes: it is lively, erudite and full of practical examples.

However, this applied mainly to landowners, and Neusner finds traces of a nascent market economy in the Mishna's treatment of craftsmen and labourers. However, he concludes that there is little economic data to be gleaned from the Mishna, whose treatment of business matters consists primarily of ethical homilies and admonitions against materialism.

This line of Kant exists only to be skewered in this book's universe, in which the sky above is obscured by a mountain of books waiting to be pulped, and the moral law the instrument of a monstrous society which so efficiently and singlemindedly dedicates itself to erasing the printed word: entire editions fresh from the press, ancient classics, famous paintings. Hanta, the narrator, sets himself in opposition to this, identifying with the animal kingdom - the mice which take up his press, nesting in the stacks of books and waging their own little wars - and with a mysterious gypsy girl who enters his life without asking, and later disappears. Like Rabelais, Hrabal takes down the idealistic conceits of his society by appeal to our basest level of humanity: human shit is omnipresent, running in the sewers close to Hanta's ears, or dousing revellers at a fancy party. A skiing trip ends when a single turd lands on Hanta's mistress's skis: apparently she has become incontinent. <br/><br/>In Hrabal's world, the enlightened ideals of Kant which claim moral superiority have led to an anti-humanist dystopia, in which ideas are fodder for the yaw of the ever-improving machines, while workers celebrate their achievements and plan holidays abroad. Hrabal - a sort of non-human, or prehuman, named 'Adam' in the novel's first draft - detaches himself from society, refusing even to drink milk, seeing sentience in the books above his bed, dreading that they will collapse on him as he sleeps in vengeance for his destructive job. His philosophical heroes, instead, are Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. In the never-ending wars of the brown and white rats we see not a political critique, but a critique of politics. This is not a satire of the socialist bureaucracy, but a claim that society <i>in re</i> is inherently inhumane. <br/><br/>Thus the presence of the Romani heroine is critical. Perennial wanderers, the Romani people are a model of a society which never settles into tyranny. They were equally persecuted by the Nazi <i>Einsatzgruppen</i> (some claim figures of up to 1.5 million were killed during the Holocaust) and by the Communists, who labelled them ""socially degraded"" and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people#Post-1945"">sterilised many of their women by force</a>. And the modern term ""Bohemian"" originates with a French appelation for the Romani, who originated from that region of what is today the Czech Republic. In these peripatetic free spirits (leaving aside for the moment whether such a characterisation is patronising or inappropriate) Hrabal sees a last remaining model for the artist in a technological age - fleeing society, and finding refuge outside its walls to pursue a life of savage, animal beauty.

Best known for his Neocon disciples and his theory of hidden, esoteric meanings in ancient texts, Strauss studied under Heidegger and, in the climate of a crisis of rationalism and the decline of European civilisation, absorbed the master's belief that the answers lay in a return to the Classics, and a pre-Modern way of life. Unlike Heidegger, though, who found succor in a type of Existentialism, and later in a mystical turn away from society, Strauss engaged with political philosophy, seeing in the pressing questions of our time an iteration of the ancient question of what consists the good life. Strauss sees the two constituent traditions of Western culture, Athens and Jerusalem - rationalism and Biblical morality - as engaged in an ongoing dialectic tension in which each can learn from and enrich the other. In the modern-day crisis of rationalism, then, he sees the result of too-great reliance on the power of Science, the detached, disinterested observation of nature. Applying this methodology in the social sciences, without the backgrounded rubric of values - Biblical morality had been discredited and finally torn down by Nietzsche, while the philsophical branch of Ethics was seen as irrelevant to science - had led us to moral relativism, and Strauss relentlessly assaults his fellow social scientists for their attempts to circumvent this inevitable conclusion. Fiery, erudite and gripping, Strauss strings together his argument, in this collection of ten assorted essays, from close readings of Thucydides and Xenophon, from Lukács and Isaiah Berlin, and from allcorners of the social sciences. Whether or not one accepts all of his ideas, he is required reading for anyone interested in Classical or medieval philosophy, or in modern-day questions of liberalism, pluralism and democratic values.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Below I've copy-pasted the rough notes I took while reading. Proceed with caution.<br/><br/>Intro<br/>Socrates believed that the goal of philosophy was to discover the good. Thus, the best political philosophy would be aristocracy - the rule of 'arete', virtue.<br/>The big change in the Enlightenment, was that thinkers like Locke and Spinoza decided that democracy would be better - abdicating the decision of the just to the individual, and letting each one try to find ""happiness"". They thought this would lead to ""the end of history"", but in fact it led to the ""joyless pursuit of joy"" - a society devoid of values. <br/>I<br/>1<br/>The cautious relativism of modern social science rejects any chauvinist claims of the Western tradition as provincialism. However, the ""preliterate tribes"" who practice their own traditions it lauds as authentic, in that they do not aspire to universalism. This approach fails when we consider a tribesman confronted with, and rejecting, western culture. This rejection does not come from a sympathetic (""histrionic"") understanding (because on what basis could one decide definitively, if rationalism is not a fair criterion?) but from an equal provincialism.<br/>Thus, social scientists only apply a quasi-moral relativism, and the resolution of this - between the embrace of Western values, or complete rejection of  absolutism - is the most pressing philosophical issue in the social sciences.<br/>2<br/><br/>Strauss weighs various approaches to moral relativism. Isaiah Berlin speaks of two types of liberty - negative (freedom from) and positive (freedom to). He stresses the first, because the second can often preclude the first - the freedom to achieve something great can sometimes only be achieved in an authoritarian society, and jettisoning personal freedom is too much of a risk. Thus Berlin is a sort of quasi-relativist - rejecting any absolute values, except for ""freedom from absolute values"", which he considers as self-evident - the ""line between the civilised man and the barbarian"". So even this attempt to flee absolutism must fall back on some absolutist ground, and cannot escape the sceptic.<br/>Strauss compares Positivism, founded in the social sciences by Weber, with Marxism, as presented by Lukacs. Marxism claims that although all truths are relative, in our current society, we can reach an objective understanding as part of the ongoing dialectic - we know we are reaching closer to the truth. This is cold comfort, if not outright obfuscation: was the Reign of Terror better for the upward historical trajectory of the French Revolution? And even Marxists beg the relativist question, one must accept their historicist narrative on faith, becaue their principles are no more absolute than any others.<br/>Next, he turns to the Existentialism which presents the best repsonse to relativism, best presented by Heidegger, but tracing its genealogy to Kierkegaard and, most importantly, Nietzsche. Nietzsche responded to Hegel, who was the first to understand historicism - that our values are contingent on our cultural mores. In response to this idea, Hegel was forced to claim that although all other societies were on a path of change and development, his own was at the pinnacle. Nietzsche rejected this and thus came up with the relativity of values. All of our values are nothing but inertia, superstition...but perhaps his 'will to power' was a replacement of nature for history, and just another relapse into absolutism. The attempt to rescue unflinching relativism from Nietszche's ""metaphysical turn"" is existentialism.<br/>3<br/>Strauss picks up the ""value question"": if the scientific method is the only rational way to proceed in the social sciences, and if science can never answer value (""ought"") questions, then how do we avoid moral relativism? Heidegger found the answer in existentialism - reducing the human experience to the fleeting, lived experience (Plato and Aristotle found the highest value in that which is always - Heidegger found it specifically in that which is mortal), turning objective into the false and misleading, and the subjective into the true (unlike Kant's transcendental subjectivity, Heidegger's system doesn't claim that there is hidden truth in the objective). Heidegger never claimed to have found an existential ethics, though, and ultimately gave up on existentialism. His criticism of it was the same as Hegel's of Kant: he historicised it. Existential anguish was only applicable to a certain time and place, Europe in decline. Nietzsche's response to Hegel was to advocate a strengthened European spirit (Übermensch) to lead a world society. After the two world wars Heidegger felt terrible despair, technology was becoming the new world religion. Technology is scientism, rationalism, Greek thought. What was necessary to resist the force of technology and recover Being (Sein) was to go back to the roots of Western civilisation and mix it with the Eastern ideal of Being, a kind of not-knowing. Hence in a sort of quasi-mysticism Heidegger finds the antidote to our modern malaise.<br/>II<br/>4<br/>Classical political philosophy must be distinguished both from general philosophy, which asks more fundamental questions, and from political science, which (purportedly) makes no judgements, but only describes, in the scientific spirit (Hegel insisted that political philosophy must describe, not legislate). The ideal political philosopher plays the role of the citizen par excellence, an umpire or arbitrator unconcerned with personal glory. The most fundamental, or constitutional question is not the merit of a political order at all - that is presupposed - but of who should rule, with the virtuous being the most obvious answer.<br/>The question then becomes the entirely theoretical one of ""what is virtue?"" but this in fact is how Plato construed political philosophy: not as philosophy of politics, but as a political (as in public) form of philosophy,  an introduction for the layman to the necessity of philosophical inquiry.<br/>5<br/>Thence the famous Straussian distinction between exoteric and esoteric meaning - it becomes clear that ancient philosophers believed in political instruction as a medium for teaching the idea of the good, through simplified, 'exoteric' forms. Living the good life is ultimately outside the cave of politics, but the polis must be lead to virtue through more accessible routes. (Exoteric rhetoric is the outward conveyance of esoteric philosophical truth - ""dumbing down"" truth for the people.)<br/>6<br/>A political historian needs a republican interest in the political, combined with wisdom. Thucydides sees two states of a civilisation: rest and turmoil. Turmoil creates the greatest achievements, but is also unstable - leads to imperialism, which was the immediate cause of the Peloponnessian war. Contrary to Plato's view of the philosopher's role being outside of politics, Thucydides sees his role as to lead: he prefers the dynamic creativity of conflict to the placid rest. Thus Plato's history (book III of the Laws) is essentially fatalistic, while Thucydides sees a small margin of human agency. He takes the question of how to live for granted, and sees the role of the leader of applying the good to the city. And that is why his history doesn't talk about culture: because the greatest wisdom can only be described in deeds. (He is famously misquoted as saying ""the nation that draws a line between its scholars and its warriors will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting done by fools"".) Both Plato and Thucydides seek the good, but Plato looks in the long term - for the ultimate good; while Thucydides takes a short term view. His view is more like the pre-Socratics. like Heraclitus, he believes that the whole is not synonymous with the sum of its parts. Since Socrates rebuffed the pre-Socratics, Xenophon took over from Thucydides in a much more Socratic direction. And for centuries history was seen as synonymous with political history, and the goal of social science to describe the best society - a special case of philosophy. Now, however, History/Soc Sci has become the description of culture, a good thing; but it has also become neutral, instead of the Platonic ideal of the philosophical pursuit of the good. But Plato is not wrong. History, says Strauss, is still ultimately political history.<br/>7<br/>i) One of the earliest presentations of Socrates is in the comedies of Aristophanes - an essentially satirical portrayal, but one not without envy and respect. (Strauss quotes Hegel to the effect that Aristophanes cannot be understood without appreciation of his essential comedy.) Aristophanes seeks both to edify, and to teach; his plays have a social lesson (the value of the pastoral life), but even this lesson is humourous in its frankness. To achieve justice, it is necessary to revolt against the harsh and punitive gods. Hegel, the greatest modern scholar of Aristoph, sees in his plays the triumph of a radical subjectivity which lampoons the expectations of society.  Aristophanes sees the family unit, as preceding the political unit (nomos), but even more, it is the caprices of the individual himself - the ultimate subjectivity - as supreme over nomos. But what Hegel gets wrong is that this subjectivity is in fact the study of nature - synonymous for the ancients with philosophy.<br/>ii)Strauss analyses the Clouds in depth. The closing debate, in which the unjust speech triumphs over the just speech, signifies for Hegel a kind of victory for subjectivity over rationalism or social norms. But, as we have said, and as this as well as Aristoph's other plays bear out, it is the study of nature which is ultimately being lauded. Yet Aristoph is also cognisant of a tension between nature and nomos, and the need for both. It is this tension which Socrates addresses.<br/><br/>Socrates is ""amusic"", i.e. unerotic and unpoetic. His philosophy transcends the human and is thus unpolitical. Unlike poetry, it is incapable of affecting the polis. The realisation that philosophy must also address the human race is the origin of political science. The later Socrates, as presented by Plato and Xenophon,  was the first philosopher to realise this. We shall start with Xenophon.<br/>Xenophon was a military leader who understood the need for discipline in order to lead men. Not for nothing were his other writings about training dogs and horses. His Socrates understands noetic heterogeneity, the essential difference between the political and the true good. And implicitly, the primacy of the political, which must protect the inner sanctum of true philosophy.<br/>iii)Aristophanes saw the poetic experience as primary, one that Socrates' rationalism cannot appeal to. Xenophon distinguishes political wisdom from the philosophical - it is different, and, if not superior, certainly primary. This is the principle of noetic heterogeneity: there are essential, irreducible differences between the law of the polis and the truth. The political is sui generis. This allows the philosopher to engage in politics. Since the wise can never convince the unwise by arguing, nor rule by force, they must enact laws. The political is thus ""wisdom diluted by consent"". (Xenophon's modern reputation is as a supporter of oligarchy over democracy.) We now move on to Plato, and the central tension between philosophy and poetry.<br/>(interim summary: Aristoph: poetry> philosophy> politics; Xenophon: philosophy =/= politics)<br/>iv) In the republic, Plato's Socrat claims that the wise must rule a city founded and logic, not myth (since if the basis is myth, the problematic behaviour of the gods arises), enforced by a noble lie. Ultimately, though, the republic seems a bit of a bust; it is unworkable, hopelessly theoretic, some think it is all an exercise in irony. Was Aristophanes right, that Socrates is a naïf? Not at all. A clue to the distinction is in the republic being the only one of Plato's dialogues which is compulsory, not voluntary. Socrates abstracts human desire into spiritedness (similar to the biblical ""heart"") and eros (in Thomistic terms, the irascible and the concupiscible). Spiritedness is unerotic, it exists to protect thwarted desire. It represents anger and murder. It is thus innately subservient, yet it is the guiding emotion of the republic. It is ruled over by philosophy. To Plato, philosophy is identical with Eros - his greatest point of agreement with Aristophanes.<br/>(Something about the theory of the forms, and the heterogeneity of matter being represented in the city, and the identity of the part with the whole - I didn't quite follow it.)<br/>v) Having grasped the significance of the Idea, by which reality can be understood, Plato stands for political philosophy against the Sophists, in whose materialist conception of the world there is no room for rigid values. But the enemy in his sights is now poetry, and he resolves this conflict by making poetry the vehicle of the noble deception, which makes it subservient to philosophy. This is how the citizens are convinced to follow their assigned roles; though in the process, the highest (because autonomous, independent) poetry is sacrificed.<br/>What is the relationship between autonomous poetry and truth? Third-hand, since poetry mimics reality, which is itself a mere ""shadow"" on the wall of the cave, reflecting but not identical with the truth. Nietzsche has said that artists at all times were the valets of a morality or religion. but poetry, in reflecting the contradictions and ambiguities of the human soul, is psychologia kai psychagogia, the very platonic science of the human. Against the materialism of the Sophists, it sees the Idea as pre-eminent. Ultimately, though, its goal is different: Plato sees finding the truth as the goal of life. Poetry doesn't consider that an option. It thus presents the epitome of the nonphilosophical life: either as a fruitless search for happiness (tragedy), or as taking refuge in the absurd (comedy). Ultimately, it remains ministerial to philosophy.<br/>II<br/>8<br/><br/>Socrat shows Euthyphron to be a dangerous heretic, since he doesn't believe (like Socrat) in piety independent of the gods, yet he does not believe (like the common people) that piety consists merely of tending to the gods (since he accused his father of impiety, and disobeying ancestral custom goes against the gods, and implies a morality independent of wisdom received from the elders). Piety is for the many, wisdom for the philosopher; attempts to fuse the two, instead of judging between them, ill follow Socrates' example.<br/>9<br/>When approaching medieval philosophers, we can only understand them properly if we approach them sympathetically, admitting at least the possibility that they are right, not just ""for their time"" but objectively. This has added salience in a time when philosophy is in crisis, torn between being a handmaiden of science, or else an ""autobiographical field"" completely cut off from rationality. Medieval Jewish/Islamic philosophy has a far more tenuous relationship with faith than in Christiandom, owing to Christianity's theological vs Islam/Judaism's legalistic natures. In Islam and Judaism, philosophy is a more secretive, hermetic art; and religion is the social structure - religion is, in effect, political philosophy.<br/>10<br/>Many Jews are now returning to Judaism, which sees the past as superior to the present, and has no exact word for progress. Yet this return isn't just a continuation of the past, it's a post-critical, qualitatively different Judaism. The idea of a) continual, upward progress b)continuing forever c) coupled with social progress, is a hybrid that exists neither in the Greek nor the Judeo-Christian tradition.<br/>The 17th century quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns was not just about French drama vs classical, but a referendum on the idea of progress. Post-Enlightenment, dazzled by the successes of science, people rejected the Bible's truth, while continuing to subscribe to its moral norms - until Nietzsche. Auschwitz sufficed to show the danger of replacing good and bad with ""progressive and reactionary"", and virtues with rights or freedoms.<br/>Greek and Biblical ideology have in common a commitment to justice, in obedience to the law, but where the Bible values humility, the Greeks praise magnanimity - there are few ""gentlemen"" in the Bible. Also, the Bible foresees a Messianic end to history, and projects an omnipotent God who requires humility from mortals. (This is why Maimonides summarises the difference between the two traditions in Aristotle's seeing the world as eternal - and the implied lack of divine oversight.)<br/>Religion assumes a concept of the ""way"", the derekh, or dharma - of cultures, animals, or nature. The ancestral holds inherent stabilising value. However, almost every culture lays a claim to universality in some sense. How do we judge between them? The Bible alludes to this: Elijah on Mount Carmel provides proof, albeit miraculous and not dialectic. Rationalist critics of religion (e.g. Hume) have attacked miracles, or the unified integrity of the text, but assuming rational grounds (eg, God should write with a consistent voice!) is a false starting point. (Take Spinoza: given his opening grounds, substance is that which is in itself and is conceived through itself, everything follows; but those first principles are arbitrary.) Philosophy's critiques of religion ultimately only work within its own framework; so do religion's critiques of philosophy.<br/>Ultimately, Strauss claims, rationality begs the question in its critique of religion (on rational grounds, which cannot ever judge the revelatory), and religion is unable to refute philosophy (the true, Eros-driven search for the rational good life; not the neutered handmaid of Christianity that is ""religious philosophy""). The strength of the Western tradition is the tension between these two conflicting traditions of Athens and Jerusalem. No-one can judge between them, and it is impossible to bridge them, if they are practiced meaningfully. What we need, Strauss says, are philosophically open theologians, and theologically open philosophers.  ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.08000000000000007,2015,2,3136.0

A novel that is a world, full of chaos, Brownian aimlessness, lust, doodles, gangsters and wide-eyed poets. Part II stretched out for me, like the crossing of an endless sea, full of engaging sights and diverting subplots but still wearying in its overall sameness. In a way this book it too big to recap: how does one distill it to a few themes? What is the connection between Arturo Belano and his creator, Roberto Bolaño? Why do we never hear directly from the former or from Ulises Lima? Is visceral realism mostly a joke, or is it in fact the tone of the novel, suffusing and bleeding into the content like the background in a Cezanne? <br/><br/>I mostly gave up on connecting the dots, instead trying to enjoy each story on its own terms, and not get fatigued or worry about where we were in the general scheme of things.

This book tells the heart-breaking story of a family that lost two sons - one to depression and one to an IED in Iraq. The vastly different responses shown to the two deaths by the military establishment led them to wage a battle against the culture of machismo that considers depression and PTSD a weakness rather than an illness. <br/><br/>From the earliest iterations of ""shell shock"" or ""battle fatigue"", the book covers the military's reluctance to acknowledge the traumatic effects of battle on otherwise healthy, courageous soldiers. Over months of research, and hundreds of hours of personal interviews, Dreazen has assembled a complete picture of a family's history and intimate life, their foibles, jokes and bonds of love. And through interviews with officers from the top ranks of the Army, he shows the challenge of changing a culture, and the army's struggle to deal with what is no less than an epidemic: the eponymous ""invisible front"", which, in 2012, took  <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/feb/01/us-military-suicides-trend-charts"">more lives than the war in Iraq</a>.

Like Whit Stillman in his movies, Kunkel is a WASPy prep school grad whose characters are likewise, except they're also dumb, lovable putzes. Kunkel's hero is a slacker with a Philosophy degree (his last name of Wilmerding becomes the email handle 'Wilmerdingansich', get it?) lacking the volition to get past his dead-end corporate job or commit to his girlfriend. Given an illicit sample of a new drug promising to cure indecision, he heads off to Ecuador to visit an old girlfriend and turn a page in his life. <br/><br/>The funny thing is that, despite the protagonist's cluelessness and obvious disinterest in politics, this is a very political book, full of angry lefties fuming about Neoliberalism and Western imperialism in the Global South. It reads very much like satire: the book's narrator feels vaguely bad and flirts with ""democratic socialism"", but never really seems to buy into the deeper economic worldview. Given the angle of the magazine Kunkel set up, though, and his subsequent move to South America and authorship of the millenial Neo-Marxist manual [b:Utopia or Bust|12949288|UTOPIA OR BUST|Yanyara|https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-4845f44723bc5d3a9ac322f99b110b1d.png|18106064], you have to assume he's at least semi-serious.

Unable to express anything sincerely, we have to give over political speeches with a self-aware smirk as if to say, <i>I know, I'm a privileged rich kid, and this has all been done before - but so what</i>. <br/><br/>Anyway, I gave it four stars because it had enough funny parts and plot twists.

For the sake of honesty, I'll state that a big chunk of it just went beyond me: I couldn't Google all of the myriad references (where I was even able to detect them; the many shrewd injokes I laughed atgacve me a gleaming of how much I must have missed), nor, in the absence of an e-copy (having had to order this from Amazon, and hopefully putting some bread in the jar of the good people at Dalkey Archive), unable to look up the words I didn't understand, I must plead the incapacity to give over a comprehensive, thought out review. All I can offer is some fragments of my gut reaction (and in parts, this is a novel which affects the reader exactly there). And recommend the very helpful notes by the author quoted by Nathan ""N.R."" Gaddis in his review.<br/><br/>Certainly this book is <i>sui generis</i>. The language is dense and daunting. Consider this opening: <br/><br/> <blockquote>Simon.<br/>Simon.<br/>Simon - you'll forgive him, the deaf seem rude among us - Simon is on a dig again. Claw up dirt, catch it, raise - aaaar-um, sprocket wheel around and dump: the fifth hole he has exhumed tonight, todawn. His sandhog immigrant hand dredge and pry. </blockquote><br/><br/>I mean - I <i>think</i> I know what's going on there, but I can't account for every word. That was my experience with the rest of the book, too. Which is paginated (and enchaptered) backwards, from around 600 to (what else?) ∞. But, weaving around that, there is a brisk, surprisingly slapstick, funny plotline, involving the abrasive and obscenely prejudiced last scion of an old WASP family trying to finance and make a modernised film version of the life of Jesus. In so doing, he dresses up as a Spanish revolutionary to reënact the nostalgic memories of a bed-ridden old woman, attends a party thrown by a creepy artist who makes sculptures based on microscopic images of bodily fluids, lies, offends, wheedles and suffers the progressive loss of his five senses. <br/><br/>And here's another thing: there's a deep religious sensitivity underpinning this book, mostly in the guise of the hero's uncle, a disgraced Episcopalian priest, but also another whose identity comes as something of a surprise (I won't spoil it). I've read that Mano's work grapples with the future direction of Christianity; making him, a playwright, novelist and TV scriptwriter, quite an ecumenical character. His formidable learning shows up in discussions about Heidegger and theology, but just when you're hooked on that, there's a dick joke and an escaped monkey or two. Mano's immersion in New York's various subcultures in second to none - his use of yiddishisms and Jewish mystical terminology is terrific. (The book's characterisation of black people, though, is shameful and shows its age.)<br/><br/>In sum: a book I was frustrated and enthralled by in equal measures. One that I would probably not recommend to anyone, but also one of undeniable depth, possessed of poetic scansion and raucous sensibility peculiar to its time and place. Few people would dedicate the time to writing a book like this, and not many more would read it; but certainly we are all richer for it.         ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.1200000000000001,2014,4,553.0

The stories within stories don't quite cohere - indeed, this book would probably work much better if it were the same length as <i>Atocha</i> - but Lerner has remembered the cardinal rule of experimental fiction: be interesting, so that if the concept doesn't come off, the reader still enjoys herself.<br/><br/>A big publisher like FSG signing on an overtly experimental author inevitably means that the book will be read by people whose goals as readers are entirely at odds with the author's intentions. Thus, Goodreads has a lot of reviews complaining about the language, and deriding the novel's dialogue as pretentious. This misses the point by a mile. Lerner is first and foremost a poet, specifically, a poet who valorises the near-impenetrable thickets of John Ashberry. He has toned his language down for the sake of this novel, to make it more novel-like, but not much: there is little plot or characterisation. <i>10:04</i> is essentially a high concept examination of time and of modalities (alternative worlds - what philosophers would call ""modal realism"") in art and fiction, of the potential innate in our past and future selves, and the possibility of finding real collectivity - of transgressing the boundaries within our isolated, class-stratified communities.<br/><br/><blockquote>I look back on the totaled city, and see it in the second-person plural. I know it is hard to understand. / I am with you, and I know how it is.</blockquote><br/><br/>There is something Hegelian in Lerner's approach: abstracting the world to a high level, and then applying the results in alarmingly specific political ways. Late on in the book, a discussion with a grad student undergoing a serious nervous breakdown is reproduced in full, and the protagonist mulls on and agrees with most of the student's conspiracy theories. That the moon landings were faked, at least in theory, is an ongoing motif in another section. Lerner's book-self is open to many sinister views of the world, and one senses that the author himself is prepared to buy into all of them.<br/><br/>In a sense, then, <i>10:04</i> is about all of these conspiracy theories, as well as animal rights, environmentalist doomsday scenarios, and class warfare. It is about creativity and assisted reproduction and faked cancer. It is about hysterical authors and wasted advances and technological disconnections. Lerner is too canny, and too distracted, to be tied down to one thing, so he makes his novel about all of them, and how all may be true and false in their own way. Such wandering can be ephemeral and short on satisfying conclusions, but that is the nature of Mr. Lerner's restless, brilliant mind. It is a great pleasure to follow along with him.

I don't generally like to belittle other people's opinions, or to play the intellectual snobbery game, so I'll just note that the reader in question wasn't the target audience for this book, and might more profitably be directed toward a different section of the library altogether. But a wider statement about society on the whole being not quite clever enough, or reflective enough, to appreciate Joy Williams's caustic genius, wouldn't be out of place when reviewing a book sizzling with barely tamped down misanthropic rage.<br/><br/>At heart, this is something like an environmentalist novel, although its bleak vision doesn't really allow for messages of any type. It simply mirrors an America full of fast-food chains and tchotchkas, addicted to television and oblivious to death. It sprawls over natural habitats with tarmac and air-conditioning, placing its non-human victims in abattoirs, shelters or museums, while congratulating itself for its sophistication, drunk with venal stupidity. Ms. Williams's cool, precise prose combines Don DeLillo's alien-like coldness with Hunter S. Thompson's righteous anger. <br/><br/>The book's major characters are all teenage girls who have suffered tragedy. Alice, orphaned, lives with her slightly batty grandparents. Corvus's parents have drowned. Annabel has recently lost her mother in a car crash, and her father (the focus of the book's wittiest and most merciless scenes) is haunted by his late wife's ghost, who takes pleasure in running him down and ridiculing his budding romance with his gardener, Donald. In another side plot, an eight-year-old girl named Emily Bliss Pickless (sic) accidentally blows off her mother's boyfriend's genitals (and buries them) and befriends a billionaire.<br/><br/>Plot exposition seems like a waste of time here, though: what makes this book so great is how funny it is, and its trenchant, subtle intelligence. Classical references abound. Two cryptic passages begin parts one and three, providing plenty of symbolism for those keen to look deeper. Every page flows with a patter of sparkling one-liners which probe through modern day humanity's delusions of success, and skewer the bromides which make us feel we are special, kind gifts to this planet.  <br/><br/>An aide at a retirement home for the especially decrepit, Nurse Daisy, encapsulates the book's theme in her stilted, oracular way:<br/><br/> <blockquote>“It’s better to be dumb,” the nurse said, “than to speak from a heart that’s all darkness and distraction. I’m agreeing with you. I suppose we should go in. Are you ready to enter our little charnel community, not as docent or guide but as a living member? Do you vow to keep your wits among the witless? Do you commit yourself to pondering ceaselessly the uselessness of caring, the uselessness of love, that great reality for which all else must be abandoned?” </blockquote>            ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,female,1.12,2014,11,482.0

At the moment, neither art nor science but mankind determining, in confusion and obscurity, whether it will endure or go under. The whole species - everybody - has gotten into the act. At such a time it is essential to lighten ourselves, to dump encumbrances, including the encumbrances of education and all organized platitudes, to make judgments of our own, to perform acts of our own...<br/><br/>With increasing frequency I dismiss as merely respectable opinions I have long held - or thought I held - and try to discern what I have really lived by, and what others live by...Our very vices, our mutilations, show how rich we are in thought and culture. How much we know. How much we even feel. </blockquote><br/><br/>That's from  <a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1976/bellow-lecture.html"">Bellow's Nobel speech</a>. A writer's writer who thinks deeply about his craft and is steeped in the Classical tradition, he represents the archetypal Dead White Guy from whose shadow everybody wants to escape - although we end up grappling with the same problems in different ways, which is the essence of this speech (aimed in its time at Robbe-Grillet's ""Nouveau Roman""). <br/><br/>I listened to an audiobook of this over a few weeks. A lot of the time I felt as if the plot had hit a dead end - it's episodic, rather than a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#Freytag.27s_analysis"">Freytagian pyramid</a>. I guess there's something Homeric in that, and in Bellow's attempt to distill the American experience into one man's story, as stressed in his opening and closing lines (""I'm an American, Chicago born...Columbus too thought he was a flop, probably, when they sent him back in chains. Which didn’t prove there was no America”.) Bellow wasn't born an American, and I've never even visited there. Is that relevant?<br/><br/>Ultimately this is an attempt to prove the lasting relevance of the old-fashioned novel, going back to the pre-Realist tradition of the picaresque novel and even the <i>Odyssey</i>. In the ideosyncratic U Chicago tradition, Bellow is convinced that the classic books contain as good an answer that we'll get to the great questions of life, and literary innovation be damned. This is his attempt to recreate one of those Great Books: it's uneven, but monumental, visionary, filled with monologues of chest-thumping patrician loftiness. It didn't quite work for me, but I certainly wouldn't write it off just because of that.   ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.8399999999999999,2014,10,394.0

His thinking is suitably eclectic. Quite simply, this book purports to be a work of philosophy (apparently one of phenomenology, though its metaphysics owe a far greater debt to Bergson than to Husserl or Brentano), but is best described as a meditation on poetry, and the connection between language and private spaces. <br/><br/>The influence of Jung's psychoanalysis looms over this book, but Bachelard believes that psychoanalytical thought, with its rigid symbolism, owns title to the world of dreams - while rationalism can explain the world of waking thought. It is in reverie or daydream, then, that he finds space for his phenomenology, describing the dimly felt sensations of intimacy we connect with the structures surrounding us. There are many passages of lyrical beauty - describing the formation of a snail shell, or meditating on a blade of grass. Bachelard attempts to transcend the inside/outside spatial distinction, cryptically paraphrasing Jaspers in the brief final chapter: ""Dasein ist rund"" (Being is round). <br/><br/>Bachelard's intention, then, is to create a poetics of metaphysics, abandoning logical preconceptions and prioritising experience: the attic, the nest, a blade of grass, a forest. He sees in the poetic imagination the best expression of this feeling, and hence a worthy fulcrum for a new description of environment. Sadly, the inherent subjectivity of such an endeavour makes for difficult, often unrewarding, reading.<br/><br/>Here's a picture of the author looking totally badass:<br/><br/> <img src=""http://hangingodes.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/gaston-bachelard_large.jpg"" width=""259"" height=""300"" alt=""bachelard""/>      ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.1900000000000004,2014,3,263.0

""You wouldn't eat a dog, so why can you eat a pig?"" is one of the central moral arguments directed in this book against eating animals. In ethics, as in life, appeals to rationality can open a slippery pathway: why, indeed, should we not eat dogs? Many cultures do? Why should we not, after careful preparation, eat dead people, a la Jonathan Swift? What we are led to is that there are simply cultural taboos which prevent us from eating certain animals but allow us to eat others. Not particularly rational, but a social construct which facilitates life on this planet.<br/><br/>2. Another argument forwarded by Safran-Foer is the comparison to slavery, once accepted but now reviled. But slavery was never as integral a part of our humanity as eating meat, nor as widely practiced. There may really be a time, several generations from now, when the whole world arises and switches to veganism, but it will not be because it is as clearly evil as forced slave labour.<br/><br/>3. Meat-eating is common in nature, but humans are uniquely capable of moral agency, in addition to being omnivores capable of subsisting on vegetation alone. But surely this begs the moral question. And the tendency of vegetarians and vegans to supplement their diet with vitamins (leaving out the tendency to recreate animal products with soya and tofu) shows the importance of meat in our diets and culture.<br/><br/>4. The bulk of this book, however, is directed at factory farming, and in this it is hard for any ethical human being to disagree with the author. The modern animal slaughter industry is a perversion and perhaps the greatest mass crime being committed in the West today. A response to that, legislatively and economically, seems imperative.<br/><br/>5. But how the individual does that is a slightly greyer issue. One way is to reduce or eliminate factory meat consumption, while supporting ethical farms - an option I have opted for. Another is to lobby, start protests, write letters, join PETA. And so on.<br/><br/>6. There is so much suffering in the world that one is sometimes overwhelmed by it. One gets a kind of moral fatigue - am I culpable for baby piglets clubbed or electrocuted to death, dolphins caught in hooks, child soldiers, mass murders in Darfur? Where does it end? It seems impossible to react to it all.<br/><br/>7. Jonathan Safran-Foer is a writer I like, who moved far out of his comfort zone to write a moving book about an issue he is passionate about. Occasionally one feels under siege by the sheer number of different arguments he rustles up to support vegetarianism - moral, religious, social, environmental, health-related. One is tempted to defend oneself, to try and justify meat-eating so that one feels like less bad a person. But that is to mistake collective guilt for individual. <br/><br/>8. I'm not attempting to defend the culture of eating animals, exactly. I fully agree (even from before I came into this book) that we as a species cannot sustain our current level of meat consumption. Hopefully, legislative and cultural changes will occur, and the current insanity of the industry will be relegated to being yet another great historical shame. But I still believe in the basic morality of eating meat, just in a vastly different way to how it is done now. There are traces of that attitude in this book, and I hope that my conclusion is one that Safran-Foer would be okay with.  ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.2000000000000002,2013,11,578.0

What we are led to is that there are simply cultural taboos which prevent us from eating certain animals but allow us to eat others. Not particularly rational, but a social construct which facilitates life on this planet.<br/><br/>2. Another argument forwarded by Safran-Foer is the comparison to slavery, once accepted but now reviled. But slavery was never as integral a part of our humanity as eating meat, nor as widely practiced. There may really be a time, several generations from now, when the whole world arises and switches to veganism, but it will not be because it is as clearly evil as forced slave labour.<br/><br/>3. Meat-eating is common in nature, but humans are uniquely capable of moral agency, in addition to being omnivores capable of subsisting on vegetation alone. But surely this begs the moral question. And the tendency of vegetarians and vegans to supplement their diet with vitamins (leaving out the tendency to recreate animal products with soya and tofu) shows the importance of meat in our diets and culture.<br/><br/>4. The bulk of this book, however, is directed at factory farming, and in this it is hard for any ethical human being to disagree with the author. The modern animal slaughter industry is a perversion and perhaps the greatest mass crime being committed in the West today. A response to that, legislatively and economically, seems imperative.<br/><br/>5. But how the individual does that is a slightly greyer issue. One way is to reduce or eliminate factory meat consumption, while supporting ethical farms - an option I have opted for. Another is to lobby, start protests, write letters, join PETA. And so on.<br/><br/>6. There is so much suffering in the world that one is sometimes overwhelmed by it. One gets a kind of moral fatigue - am I culpable for baby piglets clubbed or electrocuted to death, dolphins caught in hooks, child soldiers, mass murders in Darfur? Where does it end? It seems impossible to react to it all.<br/><br/>7. Jonathan Safran-Foer is a writer I like, who moved far out of his comfort zone to write a moving book about an issue he is passionate about. Occasionally one feels under siege by the sheer number of different arguments he rustles up to support vegetarianism - moral, religious, social, environmental, health-related. One is tempted to defend oneself, to try and justify meat-eating so that one feels like less bad a person. But that is to mistake collective guilt for individual. <br/><br/>8. I'm not attempting to defend the culture of eating animals, exactly. I fully agree (even from before I came into this book) that we as a species cannot sustain our current level of meat consumption. Hopefully, legislative and cultural changes will occur, and the current insanity of the industry will be relegated to being yet another great historical shame. But I still believe in the basic morality of eating meat, just in a vastly different way to how it is done now. There are traces of that attitude in this book, and I hope that my conclusion is one that Safran-Foer would be okay with.  ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.2000000000000002,2013,11,578.0

This turns out to be short for Paediatric Oncology, so obviously this is not a cheerful or uplifting story. <br/><br/>Nor are any of the stories, which is fine, because Lorrie Moore is the great chronicler of 'quiet desperation', of lives lived poorly by unremarkable (but well-educated) people, seeking assiduously for greater order and purpose in their lives.  In the aforementioned story, one line stuck out for me, though it isn't one of the many richly quotable one-liners that pepper this book:<br/><br/><blockquote>[E]ndings as stiff and loopy as carpenter's lace, crisp and empty as lettuce, reticulate as a net - ah, words.</blockquote> <br/><br/>Ah, words! Though her fine-grained, lapidary prose is so good, and her sense of humor so dry and likable, what defines this book for me is its characters, true to life, hopeful, anxious, sad, sometimes, but always completely real.<br/><br/>The best fiction helps us understand ourselves and how we live today, and by that standard this book is a valuable component in - to use one more music metaphor - the Adult Contemporary canon.

Besides for the mountains of literary references and the oblique angles from which Benjamin approaches his subjects, his languid, flâneur-like writing makes it difficult to follow his train of thought. Still, the beauty of such writing, and the tendency toward hyperbole so characteristic of the Frankfurt School, have no doubt played a great role in Benjamin's reputation as a critic.<br/><br/>These essays, selected by Hannah Arendt, focus on a number of Modernist writers (Proust, Kafka, Baudelaire, Leskov [whom I hadn't heard of], Brecht) and their approach to society. As a Marxist, Benjamin saw the cultural as tightly embedded in the political - as he concludes the most best-known essay in the book, <i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i>, Fascism seeks to make the aesthetic political (glorifying war and destruction), and Communism must respond by politicising the aesthetic. Thus he sees the decline of the culture of storytelling as symptomatic of the increasing demands on our time placed by industrialisation and urbanisation. Boredom, the prime condition for storytelling, no longer exists (""Reflections on the Work of Nikolai Leskov""). In another essay, he recalls Poe's and Baudelaire's respective takes on an imagined crowd scene, both regarding with growing horror the single-minded intensity of the crowd, and their utter alienation (in the Marxist sense) from each other and themselves (""On Some Motifs in Baudelaire""). <br/><br/>Benjamin is fascinated by Proust, focusing on the Bergsonian metaphysics underpinning <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>. From what I understand of Bergson's philosophy, he claims that only by ignoring our subjective experience of time and connecting to the atemporal <i>durée</i> can we transcend causality and experience true freedom. Thus Proust searches for his childhood memories, attempting to restore his unadulterated youthful happiness through mental effort. Perhaps it is not a stretch to see Benjamin politicising this thought, seeing society as undergoing a similar transformation through the overthrow of the bourgeois societal <i>status quo</i> and the return to the more authentic state of nature.<br/><br/>The other essays focus on some literary trends with remarkable prescience. One is a deep reading of Kafka's absurdism, and its relation to Jewish culture (in 1940, the year of Benjamin's death, Kafka was still a little-known figure, at least in the English-speaking world). A shorter essay describing Brecht's idea of the Epic Theatre (stripped of the attempt at realism, and full of meta-theatrical devices to confuse and startle the audience) presages Tom Stoppard, Samuel Beckett, and countless art films. The final essay consists of some rather Gnomic statements on Hegel's Philosophy of History.<br/><br/>Contrary to its subtitle, this book is rather more one of ""Reflections"", and less one of ""Essays"", in the Montaignian sense. Benjamin swirls his brush into society, politics, and art, and teases out the gossamer threads connecting artistic creation and social change. In the finest spirit of Modernism, he delves into the unconscious, seeking to understand the changes we have wrought, the ills in our society, and the ephemeral presence of beauty amongst cruelty and dehumanisation. Sadly, he could not escape the march of that inhumanity, which was close on his heels at the time that he took his own life.            ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.29000000000000004,2014,2,538.0

Just like in real life, the difficulty and the pleasure of interaction with high-level fiction is in confronting the personae of real people, and growing to understand the artifice they have built around their infant selves. And the fascination, as well as the weakness, in YA fiction, is in how it deals with people on the cusp of adulthood, expected to function as grownups, yet constantly struggling to control raging hormones, which bubble up and explode, in an out of control shouting fit - or a fiery hand, or a set of premonitions, or a flammable skirt.

The most ""kafkaesque"" feelings can be created even by his short stories (some only a few paragraphs long).

Women, perhaps - objectified, servile, never feeling sufficiently loved - are the most identifiable characters in Kafka's universe. (Needless to say, his own tortured relationship with women and sex is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka#Private_life"">well-documented</a>.)<br/>6)Another novel without an ending (and it always seems so weird when novelists end books mid-sentence.

My summary of it follows. <br/><br/>•Aesthetic appreciation is neither <u>practical</u> nor <u>scientific</u>.<br/><br/>•Beauty refers to an <u>aspect</u> of a thing, rather than the thing itself. (There are certain obvious metaphysical commitments here - in particular, Kant's <i>Critique of Judgement</i> casts a shadow over many of these ideas. Paget studied under Walter Pater, and was a product of the then-dominant British Idealism which Russell and Moore were about to smash. Russell's own semantic descriptivism inhabits a totally different universe from this.)<br/><br/>•Taking in colour is passive, but seeing shapes is  active - it's how we order the colour.<br/><br/><img src=""http://www.meisterwerke-online.de/paul-cezanne/original0724/mont-sainte-victoire.jpg"" width=""520"" height=""407"" alt=""cezanne""/><br/><br/>•An 'aspect' is: sensations grouped into relations.<br/><br/>•Perceiving beauty takes memory, to hold together the various parts (i.e. the Kantian manifold of intuition). This accounts for things like <u>symmetry</u> and <u>rhythm</u>.<br/><br/>•Einfühlung (empathy) is the psychological effect whereby the lines of a drawing are invested with an ongoing, non-innate sort of character, which ""irradiates even the most practical, the apparently least contemplative, moments and occupations of our existence"".<br/><br/>•This empathy has a <u>reiterative</u> character, which gives ongoing attraction to beautiful aspects, and in its abstract nature accounts for its existing <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i> (""fond lover, never. never canst thou kiss"" - Keats).<br/><br/><img src=""http://poetry.literaturelearning.org/files/images/Ode_to_a_Grecian_Urn.jpg"" width=""386"" height=""346"" alt=""grecian urn""/><br/><br/><blockquote>It is no poetic metaphor or metaphysical figment, but mere psychological fact, to say that if the interlacing circles and pentacles of a Byzantine floor-pattern absorb us in satisfied contemplation, this is because the modes of being with which we are obliged to invest them are such as we vainly seek, or experience only to lose, in our scattered or hustled existence.</blockquote><br/><br/>•Though we don't yet know for sure, it's reasonable to assume that historically, creating shapes preceded representations of things.<br/><br/><img src=""http://imgc.allpostersimages.com/images/P-473-488-90/74/7462/TMDQ100Z/posters/smetek-cave-painting-artwork.jpg"" width=""473"" height=""355"" alt=""cave painting""/><br/><br/>•Representing things includes <u>cubic shape</u> and <u>locomotion</u>.<br/><br/>•The point of art is to make you <u>look back to it</u>, it serves not to convey information or utility (though it may do both) and be disposed of, but to be cherished and returned to.<br/>  <br/>•These rules are for art, but they can be applied to music and literature as well (harmony is three-dimensionality in music, plot is the same in literature).<br/><br/>•Often the hassle of having to respond to things as things, or the natural fluctuation of aesthetic interest,  <br/>detract from one's readiness for aesthetic contemplation.<br/><br/><blockquote>A reader will...report days when his aesthetic appreciation has begun with the instant of entering a collection of pictures or statues, indeed sometimes pre-existed as he went through the streets noticing the unwonted charm of familiar objects, other days when enjoyment has come only after an effort of attention; others when, to paraphrase Coleridge, <i>he saw, not felt, how beautiful things are</i>; and finally...days upon which only shortcoming and absurdities have laid hold of his attention.</blockquote><br/><br/>•For this reason, aesthetic appreciation can come much easier to one who deals with art daily, even for profit; yet often eludes and frustrates gallery-goers... <br/><br/><img src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4ZQogLxD6vE/T4GGF14yDRI/AAAAAAAABxU/h9HchJznjz0/s1600/venus-de-milo.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""800"" alt=""venus de milo""/><br/><br/>•...were it not for the transferability of aesthetic experience.

Everything he says is autobiographical, including meetings with Anaïs Nin, Maya Deren, Dylan Thomas, Delmore Schwartz, and many other avant-garde superstars. But more importantly, it's completely sincere. Broyard has a wonderful nature, kind and free of pretensions. He plays down his own gifts as a jazz critic to praise the artists and writers around him, seeing past their vanity and personal problems and underlining instead their creative brilliance. <br/><br/>He wrote this unfinished memoir on his deathbed in the 1980s with undisguised nostalgia, and he casts its warm glow over everything that happened back then. And so you get a picture of a well-spent youth in an age just recovering from two wars, daring to think the unthinkable and tear down the old taboos. People live in small, run-down apartments, drink imprudently, read obsessively and fill the streets with talk of ideas. I couldn't stop underlining.     ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.27,2014,9,193.0

The existentialist flux of affable (and only mildly racist) Southern gent Binx Bolling is so much warmer and more likable than that of his Francophone counterpart. Bolling is the bearer of a certain tradition of, as his fiery aunt puts it,  <blockquote>a certain quality of spirit, a gaiety, a sense of duty, a nobility worn lightly, a sweetness, a gentleness with women - the only good things the South ever had and the only things that really matter in life</blockquote><br/>While not lionising this tradition, Percy doesn't exactly attempt to skewer it. Instead, his protagonist seems entirely value-neutral, and his goals in life amount to no more than making money, romancing his pretty young secretaries, and enjoying the movies. <br/><br/>Behind this façade, though, there is no nihilism. Bolling is transfixed: ""solitary and in wonder, wondering day and night, never a moment without wonder"". Having been through the Korean War (the traumatic experiences therein are hinted at but not explicit), he becomes transfixed by the idea of discovering meaning - whether in religion (something he distances, though a religious motif with shades of Kierkegaard runs through the novel), some kind of Spinozan naturalism (more on that later), or in the ephemera of pop culture (specifically film), his loving consumption of which forms a makeshift onotology of urban living.<br/><br/>What makes reading this novel so special is the richness and complexity of its language. Percy evokes a sun-drenched Gulf coast lined with verdant suburbs, teeming bayous and secluded beaches. His hero seeks enlightenment and meaning, a goal in which he is ultimately unsuccessful (no journey down the path of nihilism ever leads to higher ground). But his happy-go-lucky nature, and his pleasure taken from life, allows him to still experience meaning and escape the everpresent ""malaise"" cast by modern life. Asea among hysterical, avaricious and flaky family members (whose various exigencies add little to the novel, and do not enter this review), Bolling manages to wrest Homeric glory out of the jaws of uniquely modern ennui.

It plays out against a background of gentrification in Brooklyn in the early 1970s, but more importantly, it's an existential yell, a pitch-perfect rendition of a young married professional for whom everything has come easily, whose life feels eerily empty.<br/><br/>Lowell Lake comes up from a small town in Idaho to study at Stanford, marry his college sweetheart and, reluctantly, move to New York and take a job at a plumbers' weekly. The stultifying nature of his job and marriage, coupled with his retiring personality, lead him to the brink of madness. Lacking any challenge or interest, he decides to buy an apartment in <i>Brooklyn</i>, the sleaziest, most terrifying area he has ever been to. In the process of buying and attempting to refurbish an old mansion, he undergoes something like a process of renewal - though L.J. Davis is in no mood to teach lessons, and lets his protagonist's growth take second billing beneath the comic moments.<br/><br/>Davis's dry prose is laugh-out-loud funny and his plotting is terrific. This book was pure pleasure to read. It is something like a comic adaptation of <i>Crime and Punishment</i> made by the Coen brothers, set in winter in 1970s New York.

In one sense, Walser is a gentler, (reasonably) well-adjusted version of Kafka, full of self-deprecating wit and benign hopelessness. But beneath his protagonist Jakob's diffidence lies a warmth and perspicacity, executed sublimely, so that we barely notice. Observations of the busy to and fro of a city street - many degrees removed from the Benjamenta's anti-ambitious drudgery - gradually, drolly, melt into excitement: <i>I wanted to hug everybody</i>. And as the book reveals the truth behind the Institute, we understand how ""the smaller von Gunten"" is vindicated, and how only he, with his Walter Mitty-ish persona, truly grasps what his instructors are desperately trying to convey.<br/><br/>Imaginative, whimsical, and poignant, this book encapsulates strangely familiar dualities: alienation together with love of humanity, lack of ambition and hopefulness, inner peace and the urgent desire to explore. Intrinsically and without elaboration or pretense, JvG personifies the power of art, and curiosity, and freedom: and all that is exciting about reading.   ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.02,2014,5,163.0

Some part of the explanation for this must go back to the brutality of the 20th Century's two great wars, which left American soil unscathed.<br/><br/>J.L. Carr, in an astonishingly subtle and moving way, tells a story of a traumatised veteran sublimating the horrors of Ypres into his temporary assignment as an art restorer in a small northern village. Suffocated at first by the unfriendly church and minister he gradually comes out of his shell and makes connections with various figures, leading him to experience a sun-filled and life-affirming summer. Rather than contrasting this with his bitterness and spiritual loneliness, he instead isolates it into a pocket of stand-alone good cheer, reflecting that life is made up of small moments of joy, as we look forward to the next one while realising that their supply is gradually dwindling to nothing.<br/><br/>There is a poetic sensitivity and intelligence in this book, which gives it space to reflect on religion, memory, Modernism, and aesthetics within a short novella and grasp toward something concrete without offering answers, or even articulating the questions. Instead, the implications of protagonist Tom Birkin's summer slowly wash over the reader, an incoming tide of catharsis and Stendhalian aesthetic awareness. There are shadows of [b:Brideshead Revisited|30933|Brideshead Revisited|Evelyn Waugh|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1402582670s/30933.jpg|2952196]'s resigned sadness and religious overtones (but without Evelyn Waugh's conviction), and of Gaddis's exploration of religion's role in art in a post-religious world.

A lot of writers could learn from John Williams a directness and simplicity that makes his philosophical asides that much more powerful.<br/><br/>This writing style suits the protagonist, a silent and passive farmer's son whose intelligence persuades his parents to send him to university, where an English lecturer inspires him with the power of English lit, leading him on a path to tenure and modest success. From this quiet, unexceptional life - circumscribed in the opening pages - Williams derives a sort of reverse coming-of-age tale (a coming-of-old-age tale, maybe).<br/><br/>Because as Stoner's experiences broaden, his character takes on more and more depth and liveliness, even as his body prepares for the final struggle against death. In the shadows of his failed marriage, stymied career, and hopeless relationship with his daughter, he comes into himself, realising his ancestral heritage of toil and silent acceptance, making peace with his mortality, quietly proclaiming some sort of existential victory over the hypocrisy and frustrated hope which make up most of our lives.

Slater proudly parades the clichés of French travel novels: the expensive, beautiful meals, the witty banter, the nihilism, the outrageous sex. And yet, by positioning the first-person narrator on the outside, as a swotty never-was hopelessly in love with a local girl (and unable to prevent himself checking out every girl that steps onto the train), he ""queers"" the dynamic, turning the omniscient protagonist into a sort of cuckolded figure, frustrated by his loss in love, possibly harboring or repressing homosexual desires.<br/><br/>There are some beautiful, evocative passages in this book, as the narrator imagines the love affair on highways and in restaurants, in hotel rooms and in the rain. There are detailed sex scenes that seem slightly risqué even today. There is a portrayal of a quieter, modest French countryside, far from the tourist traps of Paris.<br/><br/>I don't consider this a great novel, but Slater's mastery of his craft makes it a very worthwhile one for aspiring writers. <br/><br/>    ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.7000000000000002,2014,7,195.0

There was one crucial distinction: I lived in the ""free"", post-apartheid South Africa, where the miracle of democracy had given everyone the right to vote, live where they pleased, and earn a living wage. Everyone was relieved that we had gotten rid of our great moral burden, and we could finally just be a remote, peaceful nation, welcoming tourists to our wine routes and game reserves.<br/><br/>Except that things still weren't quite right. Segregation still existed, in a more informal sense - the wealthy Johannesburg suburbs in which I lived were almost all white, sprinkled with a few black families who'd been blessed with the right connections for government jobs or lucrative contracts. Almost all of the black people I interacted with were menial workers. And there were other sides to this country with which I was completely unacquainted. Poor white farmers, blighted housing projects, all-black ""squatter camps"" (or informal settlements). Having left South Africa more than six years ago, I'm only now realising how little I ever knew it.<br/><br/>That's why reading this book felt so important. Rian Malan was a classic liberal, who flirted with Communism in his teens and fled to the US to avoid conscription. He intended to write a boilerplate book about the evils of apartheid, but in doing so he encountered the multivalent nature of Africa which has perplexed outsiders for centuries. <br/><br/>He begins with the arrival of his ancestor Dawie Malan (a chain of Malans runs through the key moments of South African history) and his flight across the Great Fish River. Throughout the book he wonders, how did we come to a situation of such hatred and fear? When the first humans left Africa and wandered off to Nordic climes, what changed in them? And when they finally returned, what caused their meeting with their long-lost brethren to be one of fear and violence? Malan repeatedly interrogates the concepts of race, peoplehood and tolerance. Africa scrambles the preconceptions of justice and fairness he imbibed with his Eurocentric education. At one point he declares ""the Enlightenment cannot penetrate here, in darkest Africa"". <br/><br/>Malan describes all manners of violence: white on black, black on white, black on black. He is driven to despair by the insensate nature of the conflict he witnesses. One section of the book describes a series of grisly murders, followed by a description of the trial and final statement of the murderer, which indicts white South Africa for the cruelty and humiliation it heaped upon the man, driving him to become a murderer. And then it goes back to the man's community and calls his account into question, portraying him as the child of an incestuous relationship, spurned by his tribe, with possible mental health issues.<br/><br/>South Africa resists easy explanations, or any explanations at all. That explains the circuitous nature of this book (and perhaps this review). Malan is unable to put a handle on everything he has seen. The violence, the sickness of his society draws him back from exile, but appears insoluble (this book was published in 1990, four years before the first democratic elections). Even now, though things are exponentially better, there are overwhelming problems of <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21590582-former-ruling-class-has-withered-outside-politics-lot-whites-are"">integration</a> and <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22554709"">protection of minorities</a>. This is a country that will never stop breaking your heart.<br/><br/>The final chapter of this book encapsulates perfectly its overall theme. It tells of Neil Alcock, a white farmer who dedicated his life to living in a drought-stricken Zulu reservation, helping develop sustainable farming systems and mediating with heartless white authorities. He spoke Zulu like a native and lived in a white hut with his wife, two biological sons, and several adopted black children. Malan chronicles, sometimes dispassionately but more often with great sorrow, Alcock's attempt to intervene in one of the constant internecine conflicts, and his resulting death. His widow is eventually robbed, beaten and threatened with death by a man she raised as her son. Droughts are followed by floods, goats trespass on the farm and destroy it, and finally even eat the flower garden she has planted on her husband's grave.<br/><br/>Yet from this heart-wrenching, infuriating story, Malan wrenches (maybe a little too easily, maybe to placate a nervous editor, who needed a strong ending - but still with great skill) a tiny piece of redemption. In an early morning ceremony, two men return to gather Neil Alcock's soul, and return it to his home. The villagers create a joyous ceremony out of this return, feasting and dancing, until even the widow joins in. And finally, something real and unprecedented has happened - documented in a paragraph of tremendous, shocking power.<br/><br/><blockquote>In the end, the sun went down and the celebrants went home, leaving the horns of the sacrificial cattle nailed to the room of the home. The horns were a reminder of the ceremony performed that day, a sign that the household within had honored its shades. In a continent where people worship their ancestors, Neil Alcock had become a god - the first white god in Africa, as far as anybody knows. Aeons after our ancestors walked away, the first white man had come home to Africa to stay.</blockquote><br/>        ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.7699999999999996,2013,7,871.0

I know, kind of silly, since almost all of their stuff is online. But I like the short stories, often, and I like feeling the thickness of the pages when I read it outside. One thing I've picked up from the issues I've read is that there seem to be a lot of writers who are seen as touchstones in American fiction, most of whom are completely unfamiliar to me - what I have begun to call the MFA canon. It includes names like James Salter, Marilynne Robinson, John Williams, Lydia Davis, Grace Paley, Joy Williams, Lorrie Moore, Evan S. Connell, and at the top of the chain, the Tolstoy and Flaubert of the canon, John Cheever and Raymond Carver. The defining quality of this fiction is a very minimalist, introverted, calmness. It concerns itself with the domestic lives of mild-mannered people, who observe the world with a wry wit and defeated mien. Overly complex plots are rare. I get the sense that MFA students, focused on recreating this lapidary, elegant prose, aren't going anywhere near the experimental pyrotechnics of John Barth or Thomas Pynchon or D Foster Wallace (perhaps the latter, only through his short stories).<br/><br/>Which isn't meant as a criticism at all. The stories that the <i>Review</i> prints - some indie writers, some stuff from the slush pile, whatever Zadie Smith is working on - are superb. Having never been in an MFA program, I'm more at the stage of learning and processing than critiquing. But there seems to be a cluster of influence here that I've only just begun discovering. (Can someone let me know if this is what that whole [b:MFA vs NYC|18248379|MFA vs. NYC  The Two Cultures of American Fiction|Chad Harbach|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1386380672s/18248379.jpg|25701143] thing was about?<br/><br/>Anyway, this collection of short stories is another book by a ""writer's writer"" that I'd place firmly in the canon. The first four stories are five-star brilliance. They, like the rest, concern American expats living in Botswana, mostly as aid workers or government contractors. Norman Rush lightly describes the lives of  well-off, educated Westerners living in a society filled with danger and poverty and great kindness. Africa is filled with contradictions and causes people's values to veer wildly and their identities to change, like a psychic Bermuda Triangle. <br/><br/>While most of the characters are the eponymous Whites, one story is narrated by a native BaTswana in broken English, and, amazingly, comes off as wonderfully sympathetic and real, without an ounce of condescension. Rush finds his characters frustrated and tired, overshadowed by an ever-present drought (mentioned roughly once every ten pages). But like the physical one, their spiritual drought refuses to break. Africa still eludes them, as it has eluded every writer seeking to get to the bottom of it. Rush wisely doesn't try that. His style is naturalist and authentic, and perfectly suited to his subject.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.22999999999999998,2014,8,483.0

Leys (a pen-name for Pierre Ryckmans) examines Chinese poetics and aesthetics in what was for me the book's most interesting part. He examines a connection perceived by the Chinese between the moral value of an artist to the quality of his art, and strongly endorses it.

Sebald, got me to the finish. I saw the film first, Béla Tarr's slow-paced portrayal of innocence vs mob rage. That's broadly the theme here, but the book is more than a little resistant to thematic analysis. For one, János (called Valuska in the novel) is far less prominent as the central character. His mother, the bitter and conservative Mrs Plauf, frames the beginning and end-pieces. Decomposition is a major theme, still; there's a connection to musical theory via the anxious musicologist Eszter, whose efforts are ultimately thwarted by his wife's plans of domination. The theme of death and destruction is reinforced by a bleak ending piece titled 'Sermon on the Grave'. The film made me think of the violent history that Hungary has seen in the last century, but the book feels atemporal and certainly much less political.<br/><br/>Everything in this book is vague, including the words themselves. Krasznahorkai never inserts paragraph breaks (I finished this the same weekend as Thomas Bernhard's <i>Concrete</i>, another example of this practice) and constantly interjecting characters' thoughts in quotes <i>in the middle of their own monologues</i>. I think there's a kind of irony in this - the cliches people think in, but are embarrassed to vocalise. Being aware that something is a cliche but using it anyway with knowing distance makes this Hungarian hermit a level-A hipster, or millenial, or whatever. A passage later in the book might be explaining it<br/><br/><blockquote>Enough of this...claptrap! Ever since dawn I have had to listen to nothing but retarded babble...you don't talk, you ""whisper"" or ""expostulate"", you don't <i>walk</i> down the street but ""proceed feverishly"", you don't <i>enter</i> a place but ""cross its threshold"", you don't feel <i>cold</i> or <i>hot</i>, but ""find yourself shivering"" or ""feeling the sweat pouring down you""! I haven't heard a straight word for hours. (pg 278; New Directions 1989)</blockquote><br/><br/>The implication is almost that the destruction perceived by the characters is exaggerated, or at least misinterpreted. But the book doesn't really offer any other clues, nor does it give us an explanation about the Prince or his powers. <br/><br/>The 'pomo' tag is for that, and this epic closing line<br/><br/><blockquote>It ground the [body] into carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur, took their delicate fibres and unstitched them till they were dispersed and had ceased to exist, because they had been consumed by the force of some incomprehensibly distant edict, which must also consume this book, here, now, at the full stop, after the last word.</blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,2.1799999999999997,2013,10,428.0

Continental philosophers, liberated by Kant from the need to ground their intuitions empirically, have taken on the grand mantle of philosophy of old: metaphysics, aesthetics, history. Analyticals, mostly concentrated in the Anglophone world, have preferred to focus on more modest fields, mostly of modern provenance: philosophy of language, mathematics and science; and formal logic. (The one exception might be Analytical philosophy of mind, which goes back to Descartes and Leibniz, and has antecedents in Classical Philosophy.) <br/><br/>G.E. Moore sits firmly in the second camp, but ambitiously attempts to reclaim the field of ethics to the analytical fold. To do so, he begins by clearing up a lot of the incorrect notions which had accumulated in the field, including hedonism, utilitarianism, and Kantian ethics. Pretty much every serious study of ethics has at some point fallen back on an appeal to nature or the like. Moore calls this the ""naturalistic fallacy"". Having dismissed all of the rest, he attempts a positive construction of what might be defined as good, and thus as desirable.<br/><br/>And here is where he stumbles. Freely admitting that much work remains, Moore (himself known for his high ethical character, incidentally) struggles to define exactly what we might consider good, and on what basis. Especially in the field of aesthetics, his own judgments seem to veer dangerously close to the naturalistic fallacy. The assumption that some virtues are inherently good, while tempting, does seem to need more formal grounding.<br/><br/>The strength of this book is in its thorough and clear examination - and repudiation - of most of the previous ethical theories to gain currency in the Western world. But the spectre of Postmodernism haunts this book: as logical positivism crumbled to dust by mid-century, Continentals would turn to moral relativism, while Analyticals would withdraw from the field altogether. Neutral moral judgments, seen as intuitive to most of us as children, aren't nearly as simple as they appear.  ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.18999999999999995,2013,9,340.0

OK, I'll stop recreating the style, but it really is something, challenging and absorbing. Tsypkin fetishises Dostoevsky, in all his greatness and smallness - his gambling, his jealousy, petty feuds with literary scenesters (particularly memorable is the portrayal of lofty, leonine, Turgenev; a lit celeb surrounded by admirers and aristocrats, dropping witty <i>bon mots</i> in French; exactly as Tolstoy - like Dostoevsky, a passionate Slavophile - portrays the decadent bourgeoisie in W&P). Following in the master's footsteps, all the way to the Dostoevsky museum in St Petersburg, Tsypkin immerses himself in the parallel world he has created and attempts to grasp the measure of the man. FD's antisemitism is prominent (references to ""nastly little Jews"" abound) and toward the end Tsypkin zeroes in on it, grappling with it without giving concrete answers. But the ending, with the author sitting in the house of an elderly, religious Jew, still beleagueredly keeping up her faith despite decades of Soviet persecution gives something of an answer. In raw, passionate paragraphs, this slim novel gives over a lasting image of a life. And by its existence, as a lost work of a frustrated Soviet Jew, who died without ever being published, repeatedly denied an exit visa, it testifies just as eloquently to another forgotten life.

At its heart is a critique of no less than Western rationalism - and, since Hume, the lackings in that system have been all too painfully aware to us. <br/><br/>Pirsig sees the idea of 'quality' as parallel to the pre-Socratic concept of the good, which was usurped by Platonic epistemology, effectively placing 'the truth' above the good, with the ensuing subject-object dichotomy. Our fragmented world view is in effect, a lack of awareness of our place in the greater scheme of things, from which we derive satisfaction/meaning in life, or what Pirsig terms 'gumption'.The philosophy is solid, but the conclusions, a radical rejection of Western philosophy, warrant more depth than they are given in between the narrative.

I understand some of what Ballard might be going for here: a world devoid of morality, anodyne, soulless automatons going through anhedonous lives as metaphor for the modern condition. <br/><br/><br/>But this book is neither fun nor meaningful: it's too long, flat, bland and pleasureless, which makes me think that it might just work as performance art: the struggle of getting through such half-assed hackery as metaphor for a very bleak existence. <br/><br/>Anyway, I found it kind of distressing to be so underwhelmed by a book I'd been so looking forward to, so I availed myself of John Updike's criticism rules to see if I'd been fair, or at least to make my opinion completely clear in my own mind.<br/><br/><b>1. Try to understand what the author wished to do, and do not blame him for not achieving what he did not attempt.</b><br/><br/>As an airport paperback, it's OK - though not enough to keep me from compulsively checking how much was left.<br/><br/><b>2. Give enough direct quotation—at least one extended passage—of the book's prose so the review's reader can form his own impression, can get his own taste.</b><br/><br/>""Crossing frontiers is my profession. Those strips of no-man's land between the checkpoints always seem such zones of promise, rich with the possibility of new lives, new scents and affections. At the same time they set off a reflex of unease that I have never been able to repress.""<br/><br/>That style is pretty much two thirds the book. <br/><br/><b>3. Confirm your description of the book with quotation from the book, if only phrase-long, rather than proceeding by fuzzy précis.</b><br/><br/>Can't do this one as I don't have a physical copy. (Maybe that was the problem?)<br/><br/><b>4. Go easy on plot summary, and do not give away the ending.</b><br/><br/>☑<br/><br/><b>5. If the book is judged deficient, cite a successful example along the same lines, from the author's œuvre or elsewhere. Try to understand the failure. Sure it's his and not yours?</b><br/><br/>Well, it's hard to find a comparable author. Maybe a crime writer like Raymond Chandler? Maybe after <i>The Drowned World</i>, I'll have a better grasp of what I'm dealing with.<br/><br/>I think the failure is in subject matter, making a creepy, alienated feeling into a book length murder mystery. I could have done without a lot of the exposition. I just want to read enjoyable prose, or find some kind of <i>recognition</i> in what I'm reading - even a Kafkaesque sort of recognised alienation.  <br/><br/>And the final rule:<br/><br/><b>6.Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike...never try to put the author ""in his place,""...Review the book, not the reputation. Submit to whatever spell, weak or strong, is being cast. Better to praise and share than blame and ban. <br/><br/>The communion between reviewer and his public is based upon the presumption of certain possible joys of reading, and all our discriminations should curve toward that end.</b><br/><br/>I spend a lot of time these days thinking about what it is that makes fiction enjoyable, and why we pursue it so avidly. Whatever that mysterious factor is, here it is absent. Reading this book was a pleasure I'd gladly have yielded.<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,2.45,2014,4,689.0

The erudite intro to my edition (not written by Jonathan Saf-Fo, though his weird concept-art reëdit of this did lead me to discovering it, so thanks are due) discusses how Schultz basically felt that certain momentary childhood feelings mark all of us at some point, and our artistic, spiritual and literary efforts are all an attempt to regain or at least delineate that simple joy. <br/><br/>Thus this novel: descriptive words abound (the rococo prose, full of botanical/zoological/architectural arcana, had me repeatedly mashing the dictionary feature on my e-reader), magical things happen, simple elements of small-town family life are elevated to Biblical or mythical dimensions. There's a self-proclaimed rewriting of the book of Genesis on more humanist terms, involving the character's father's creation of a homunculus and a comet (he must have read <i>War and Peace</i>, right?) and the titular stories (in the Polish original and the translation, respectively) ""Cinnamon Stores"" and ""The Street of Crocodiles"". Those in love with <i>100 Years of Solitude</i> will probably go for this too - I didn't love the former, but I did appreciate the relative brevity of the latter, plus everyone not being called Arcadia or Buendía.<br/><br/>Schultz was sadly cut down in his prime, a shy and sweet writer who had a Kafkaesque way of seeing absurdity in the world, but an infinitely brighter disposition. His childlike intensity and erudition are matched with an artist's eye. With these tools he created surreally beautiful and unique literary structures which, even when not totally cohering, stand far apart from any of his contemporaries. We can only wonder what he would have made of the disillusionment of the post-holocaust world, that inspired such wholly different artistic endeavours.  <br/>  ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,1.1500000000000004,2014,5,310.0

Shavit distills the focal points of Zionist history into thematic chains, interrogating the traditionally accepted Zionist narratives of ""Shoah to uprising"" and ""making the desert bloom"", while acknowledging and celebrating the accomplishments of the early state in so many fields (unlike more curmudgeonly leftists of the ilk of, say, Uri Avnery). Going through his family's past in the country, beginning with his English great-grandfather, Shavit weighs up the great successes of Israel along with its dark secrets, and ponders its future in its current state.<br/><br/>With impeccable professionalism, the author gives a sympathetic journalistic ear to people from all over the political spectrum, ranging from messianic right-wing Jews to business oligarchs to Arab activists. In between, though, he doesn't hold back on his own views. His peace credentials are solid, having spent many years working at peace organisations and as a columnist at left-leaning <i>Ha'aretz</i>, but Shavit is wary of Israeli leftists who blame all of the country's ills on the Occupation, ignoring the broader regional context of hostility in which Israel has always existed.  <br/><br/>Weak points: like his <i>New Yorker</i> colleague Malcolm Gladwell, Shavit has an annoying tendency to ""storify"" his chapters - after announcing a chapter's theme he will sum it up in a few trenchant questions (<i>what</i> was the defining aspect of the pioneers? <i>can</i> Israel survive in the twenty-first century?) and then immediately follow it up with a couple of personal biographies and interviews with the characters he has chosen to give the definitive answers. His writing is also a bit overwrought (looking over the GR reviews, it seems I'm not the first to pick up on this). Everything is defining and heart-breaking and pivotal, all of the people are beautiful and brilliant and talented.<br/><br/>Still, there are few books on either the history or contemporary state of Israel containing as much in-depth knowledge and consummate skill as this one. Whether talking about Jewish-Arab co-existence in Mandate Palestine, expulsions of Arab villagers, or nightclubs and social protests in 2013, Shavit brings an unmatched scope and clarity to his subject. In a conflict in which every detail is disputed and the future is shrouded in doubt, this is probably the closest you can get to a reliable survey.

Sheer bloody-mindedness compelled me to continue. I'm so glad that I did. This book grows on you slowly, and, in adjusting you to the sharply realised Pollit crew, demands your complete emotional investment.<br/><br/>The titular character is the immensely annoying patriarch, Sam, the prime factor in one's desire to put down the book - that is, until you realise what a monster he is; that his childish speech, sexism and huge egotism make living with him impossible. His wife Henny - plagued with plenty of her own issues, as becomes clear later on in the book - gave up on her marriage from the outset, spending most of her free time engaged in playing solitaire (the focus of one of the phenomenal set pieces towards the end). There are some powerful scenes where the two parents have it out, reminiscent of the Sopranos episode ""Whitecaps"" in their emotional intensity, crackling with the repressed frustration of wasted decades. There is a black thrill in seeing the toxicity of the Pollit family dynamic seep outward, starting from Sam, the oblivious source of all the trouble.<br/><br/>Sam is self-pitying and self-centred. He takes for granted that his opinions are supremely important to the world, that he is a martyr held back by his loved ones. Anyone familiar with such a character in real life will recognise the tendency to hold forth at length about issues instead of discussing them, to flinch from criticism or see it as a personal attack, and to alternating spite and wounded humility. <br/><br/>By contrast, the children adjust to their circumstances fairly well, as children tend to do. Ernie is calm and prudent, carefully planning out the savings in his money box and accounting for the expenses of birthday presents. Saul and the younger ones are generally cheerful, relating perfectly to their father. In this sense he does love children: young, malleable minds, eager to learn, interested in nature, accepting authority without question. But in the oldest daughter Louise he finds a resistance that curdles into hatred: his dismissal of her complexity, and insistence that she fall into his entourage of admirers, drives her into open, not quite futile, revolt.<br/><br/>This is a challenging but beautifully written book. It requires the reader to learn about a family mostly by observing their speech patterns and chaotic daily life. Like reality TV, but less polished, it places before us regular people in whom we will see myriad things wrong, but nothing that we would know how to improve, because we know how our own relationships tend to tangle into Gordian knots of denial and dissatisfaction. Like real life, the family in the book is irreducible to simple dichotomies or pop-psychology cliches. (It was apparently based mostly on Stead's own upbringing in Australia.) At first it resists you, but eventually you begin to love its sad, well-intentioned characters, and by the time the closing sequence of events commences, bringing wave after wave of heartbreak, you are too firmly in its grip to let go. This is a big-hearted novel, which paints growing up and family life in spectacular dimensions.         ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,female,0.43000000000000016,2014,3,550.0

Something subversive lies in these two books - which are so ripe with scatological humour and hanky-panky - and one wonders how much this contributed to their enduring popularity. Both, too, along with <i>Don Quixote</i>, contain metafictional elements (Chaucer's cameo narration, <i>G&P</i>'s endless made up books), symptom of a certain experimental zest that elevated them above the primordial ooze that was lay literature from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance.<br/><br/>I was exposed to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotesque_body"">Bakhtin's famous reading</a> long before I read this, but I wasn't quite aware what sensational fun the degradation of the human anatomy could be.

Whole cities drowning in urine, mustard poop, giant babies with yard-long erections. It's so surreal, so over the top, that it begins to feel realistic again.<br/><br/>What is life, if not a giant codpiece? How does anything make sense? It certainly doesn't when you accept the conventions of polite society, today or five hundred years ago. Asking these kinds of questions is how the seeds of the Enlightenement were sown, and it's behind every really great novel.       ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.2999999999999998,2014,6,233.0

Yesterday I was browsing GR for some good books on the commodification of culture, kind of hoping to find someone who could summarise Adorno and Horkheimer without being too dense and jargon-loaded. On a whim I picked up this book instead. It's a light read which you can fly through in one determined sitting. Basically, it goes to the opposite extreme: it's the little guy, giving the sceptical winking brosplanation to what all those mixed-up eggheads are talking about.<br/><br/>Klosterman, in his congenial tone, likes to expand his pop culture observations into Universal Rules, neatly resolving everything he surveys into simple, distinct binaries. Soccer, unlike real American sports, ""represents outcast culture"". Pamela Anderson, in contrast to Marilyn Monroe, represents sex in the 90s vs the 60s. Everything makes perfect sense!<br/><br/>I'm baffled as to how people seem to hate on this book because it's for and about pretentious hipsters. I <i>love</i> pretentious hipsters! I wish Klosterman had been a pretentious fuck, instead of unambitiously middlebrow, in the worst sense of the word. Instead of geeking out on musical arcana like the people he pokes fun at, Chuck spent his college years doing ordinary things: beer pong, watching sports, getting wasted. Which is fine - and explains the everyman disdain he holds for the pointy-headed music critics who convene in the final essay to discuss academic perspectives on hip-hop and cock rock. Klosterman takes on the mantle of middleman, interpreting the gist of what they have to say: mostly disdaining how out of touch and ridiculous they are, and idly throwing in his own half-assed ideas with a ""postmodern"" and ""ironic"" thrown in here and there in non-threatening ways. This is the dumbed-down version of academic culture studies.    <br/><br/>Most of this book has aged pretty well, besides for the essay on print media, and a curiously prudish chapter on porn. Those looking for a superficial, easily quotable read will enjoy it, but if you want an analysis with some level of depth, you might want to consider someone who actually internalised some of the show-offy parts of his college experience.

Whether SK's anguished existentialism is relevant to today's phenomenologists and postmodernists, or if they're just meandering apologia, is a call I'm not yet ready to make. <br/><br/>[Addendum: In my mind I couldn't help connecting the Platonic pursuit of Logos - Kierkegaard's Ethical Religion - with modern scientific positivism. But the ways in which SK critiques it are primarily archaic, mystical abstractions. Ontologically, it might matter if I'm compelled to pursue the Ideals once I understand them, and if the either/or dichotomy of knowledge/ignorance truly encompasses all of human behaviour. But as a system of practical ethics, a scaled-down version of this works for most people. SK's goal is to discover an existentially authentic metaphysics, grounded in Greek philosophy but realisable only in Revealed Faith. That hasn't been supplanted by anything (not to discount efforts by the likes of Heidegger and Foucault). But I still have doubts as to the coherence and workability of SK's <i>weltaunschaung</i>. Ultimately, I suspect that he remains what he was in his own time: ignored by the masses; a philosopher who was, and wrote only for, lonely, thoughtful individuals.] ",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.9699999999999998,2014,5,232.0

Which is bleak, hence the alternative ""lightness"" - doing things only once (<i>einmal ist keinmal</i>).

But the characters of Quixote, Sancho Panza, Rocinante, etc are affable and occasionally insightful enough to make the journey passable, especially on a soothing audiobook, after a long work day; in some sense, the way all stories are meant to be told.<br/>4)It is  perhaps owing to the metafictional weirdness bits of Part II for which the plaudits come in. The intertextuality is unexpected, out of place. Quixote's relationship to the author, and the people around him being aware of him <i>qua</i> literary character, adds a completely new dimension to the story.<br/>5)The ending is also surprisingly sentimental. It seems to confirm that this book is in fact a satire, though at so many times thorughout the novel we, like Sancho, are questioning our understanding of reality. Don Quixote can be tragic, comic or inspiring. In his questioning of the value of (then-)conventional literature, and his spirit of adventure in the face of reality, common sense and repeated adversity, he is an agent of change, triumphantly heralding a new literature, adhering more closely to mimesis of a multivalent and confusing world.

Lawrence presents his relationship with his mother, and the other women in his life, in all its glory. Beginning with the marriage of his parents - ill-advised and irreconcilable almost from the start - he develops the increasing reliance of his mother (here dubbed Mrs Morel) on him (Paul) and his brother William. It's hard not to read the title as a reference to the weirdly Oedipal bond between mother and son, and not to the protagonist's barely consummated relationships.<br/><br/>It's a shame that, narratively speaking, things are so chaotic, perhaps as an outgrowth of the autobiographical nature of the story. Characters like Arthur are half-formed, much of the action seems unrelated to the core of the story, and - most critically - it's difficult to relate to the decisions taken by the main character. Lawrence never clearly states/analyses his emotional struggle. Instead, he relates isolated incidents, chronicling his slow abandonment of would-be lovers and frustrated relationship with his mother - leaving the reader, like himself, estranged, bitter, confused.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.6299999999999999,2014,2,187.0

For some, it is uplifting and enchanting, while for others its sweetness sticks in the throat. This book follows several generations of the Buendia family of the village of Macondo, Colombia. They fall in love, have children (who they name after themselves, making it hard at times to keep track of things) and die. <br/><br/>There are moments that are likely to make you smile, and a very satisfying ending that nearly moved me to give it another star, but ultimately finishing this book was something of a chore. The characters are motivated by lust and superstition, usually to their own disadvantage. We stumble from one catastrophe to another. One interesting part of the book looks at the massacre of thousands of banana plantation workers by the company's ruthless overseas owners. <br/><br/>There are presumably points being made here about Colombia's history, the nature of human sexuality, and other universal topics. Perhaps I was inured to them by my Western sensibilities, unable to parse literary prose based on mythology and not salon discussions. Either way, I was vanquished by this book. It has a large and loyal fanbase, but if I am to join it, I will need to reread the book with a fresh mind - and I promise, that will not happen soon.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,2.0700000000000003,2013,6,231.0

That this book works at all owes less to the titular Catch and its concomitant ironies - which quickly become irritating - than to its surprisingly poignant descriptions of the boredom, humiliation and occasional abject terror of army life. <br/>It is densely plotted, with an exploded chronology that can be hard to follow. But there is a clear divide between the exaggerated slapstick of the first two thirds, and the somber ending. The graft feels a little unnatural. Toward the end the generals abruptly metamorphose from bumbling idiots to menacing, Stalinist-style inquisitors. But behind all of these missteps, Heller is a strikingly accomplished prose stylist, and he evokes the horrors of war with great power.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,male,0.98,2013,8,147.0

""But I did not want to."" At times, you may find yourself wishing he did, as his farcical show trial (which largely inspired George Orwell's '1984') drags out, step by incriminating step.<br/><br/>But it is the lengthy dialogues in which this book really shines, and where I began to understand the critical regard in which it is held. Rubashov is an old, loyal Party man who has finally diverged from his former comrades, including the sinister, Stalin-esque 'Number One', with whom he has always had an uneasy relationship. His arrest and interrogation come as little surprise to him - even, perhaps, a relief, during a time of constant purges - and he faces his fate with a stoic calm. His interlocutors are his old friend Ivanov and a humourless younger officer named Gletkin.<br/><br/>The characters debate the Machiavellian ethics of Stalinism. Ivanov claims that ""the ends justify the means; that was and remains the only rule of political ethics"". He sees the attainment of the socialist utopia as justifying any evils perpetrated by Party members. But both Ivanov and Rubashov feel moments of regret and cynicism, as they can see that the situation is not progressing as they had imagined.<br/><br/>Rubashov is a sensitive intellectual, in stark contrast with a lecherous neighbour in prison and with Gletkin, whom he sees as a ""Neanderthal"". He struggles to find meaning and reason in what is happening around him. The state has not achieved its goals, and has instead become an instrument of immense evil. <br/><br/>The questions raised by this book concern not only Marxists and members of the Left, but all human beings. In a society without God, how do we create meaning? Can groups of people ever be trusted not to abuse their power? If we labour to better ourselves, but are only left with heartbreak, should we then not have tried?<br/><br/>In the midst of his discussion with Ivanov, Rubashov brings up Raskolnikov from Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment'. Ivanov scoffs. ""Raskolnikov acted only for himself,"" he asserts. ""Had he been acting for the party, his actions would have been fully justified."" In this world of steely ideological certainty, there are no doubts. All morality is defined by the needs of the people. Bitter, facing down a world of darkness, Rubashov emphatically disagrees.
